<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>In sending forth this brief account of my long
chaplaincy in Paris, I desire to say that I do so at
the request of many friends, who were kind enough
to express their interest. It is not intended to be an
account of life generally in Paris, or a description of
the beauties and treasures of the City. There are
many books which do this better than I could hope
to do, for the life of a chaplain in Paris is a very
strenuous one—every day bringing its work, and
often much unexpected work, that it was difficult
to give much time to sight-seeing. My predecessor,
Rev. T. Howard Gill, said to me when I accepted the
position, “Do not stay more than seven years—it is
enough for any man.” I stayed nearly seventeen.
I have not attempted either to give any full account
here of the spiritual side of my work—I would only
say that I have every reason to thank God that
I went, both for the work He enabled me to do and the
experience that I have gained. There is an erroneous
impression in some minds about Continental work,
viz., that it unfits a man for Parochial work at home.
I heard this expressed upon my appointment to my
present sphere. The fact, however, is very different.
The work is so varied, so constant, and often so unexpected,
that one gains as much experience in six
months in a city like Paris as British Chaplain as one
would gain in a much longer time at home.</p>

<p>It may be true that in small chaplaincies in lonely
places, with but few English people in residence,
men get out of touch with Church life and work in
England, but it is not the same in the permanent
chaplaincies in thickly populated places.</p>

<p>In Paris we had our organisations much as at
home. Daily Services, Sunday Schools, Mothers’
Meetings, Visitors, etc., and although the numbers
attending (owing to distance) were not so great as at
home, the work was much the same.</p>

<p>I have given several hints which I trust may be
useful to parents intending to send their children
abroad for education, and also to those who may be
purposing to reside in Paris.</p>

<p>As we are going to press the notice appears in the
papers of the death of Sir Edmund Monson, formerly
Ambassador in Paris. The country loses in him a
distinguished and faithful servant, and all who knew
him will regret a kind and generous friend.</p>

<span class="smaller">ROYAL AND OTHER VISITS.</span></h2>

<p>The Daily Press has naturally recorded the visits
of Royalty, Members of Parliament, the Lord Mayor
of London, etc., to Paris during the period of which
I write, but as in each case there were services in the
Embassy Church, there are certain facts from the
chaplain’s point of view which will, I hope, be of
interest to my readers. A clerical friend once said to
me, “Everybody who is anybody has been to your
Church in Paris.” It certainly was a fact that during
my chaplaincy many distinguished people attended
the ordinary Divine Service besides the crowds at
special times when Royalty was present. I may
mention the late Duke of Devonshire, the Right Hon.
W. E. and Mrs. Gladstone—who often came twice
on the Sunday when visiting Paris—H.R.H. the late
Duke of Cambridge, who was many times present.
On one occasion the Duke arrived in Paris from a long
journey early on Sunday morning, but he was in the
Embassy gallery at the 11 o’clock service. Upon his
late visits—and he was in Paris not long before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
end—he was unable to face the stairs to the gallery,
and sat below with the congregation. In the early
days of my chaplaincy, the late Sir Condie Stephen
was an attaché at the Embassy, and a most regular
attendant at both morning and evening services. The
late Archbishop of Canterbury was once at service in
my time, and sent me a most kind message. Bishops,
Home, Colonial, and American, were occasionally
seen, and many clergy. I noticed on two or three
occasions Mr. Pierpoint Morgan among the worshippers.
On one occasion four English dukes were
present at morning service. The late Sir G. Stokes,
Sir W. Freemantle, Lord Rathmore, and the other
members of the Suez Canal Board were regular in
attendance month by month, the former a devout
worshipper and a kind, genial friend.</p>

<p>Great interest was naturally excited in the
English Colony when we had Royal visitors.
Her late Majesty was not in Paris during my Chaplaincy,
although she was several times in the South of
France, being usually met at some convenient station
by the President of the French Republic. Whatever
may have been the feeling of the French people
towards the English before the “Entente Cordiale,”
they always had the highest respect and admiration
for our beloved Queen, and I never heard that she met
with the least annoyance from “the most polite
nation in the world.”</p>

<p class="caption">RUE DE RIVOLI.</p>
</div>

<p>Before coming to the special subject of this
chapter, I should like to say a few words about the
English Church in the Rue d’Aguesseau, which has
always been known as, and is “ipso facto,” the
Embassy Church. In former days the English
services were held in the ballroom at the Embassy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
itself, and there was a resident chaplain. I have
heard that there was sometimes rather a “rush”
after a Saturday night’s ball to get the room ready
for divine service on Sunday. This “Chapel” was
also at that time somewhat of a Gretna Green, where
at twenty-four hours’ notice young couples who had
difficulties at home could be united according to
English law by a resident chaplain. My friend, Dr.
Morgan, of the American Church, kindly sent me a
volume of sermons he had picked up on a bookstall,
bearing the title “Sermons preached at the Chapel of
the British Embassy, and at the Protestant Church of
the Oratoire in Paris, by the late Rev. E. Forster,
M.A., Chaplain to the British Embassy.” This was
in the days when Lord Stuart de Rothesay was
Ambassador to the court of France, and the
volume bears the date 1828. I believe Lord Stuart
de Rothesay was twice Ambassador in Paris—an
unusual circumstance. Services are no longer
held in the Embassy. The English Colony in
Paris having largely increased, it became necessary
to provide a suitable building as a church,
and at the period when the late Lord Cowley
was Ambassador, and largely through his instrumentality,
the present Church was purchased, and has
from that time to the present been the Embassy
Church, where all services of a public and diplomatic
character have since been held. Here is a French
description of the building, which, while not exactly
ecclesiastical, is yet loved and valued by the English
Colony.</p>

<p>“L’Èglise Anglicane est située à moins de 100
mètres de la porte de l’Ambassade. C’est un petit monument
de style Gothique, aux fenètres ogivales, aux frùes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
colonnes fleuronnées. A l’intérieur, la chapelle est
meublée de deux rangées de bancs, placées face à l’autel.
Devant celui-ci se trouve l’aigle de bois doré dont les
ailes éployées portent les Livres Saints; à gauche les
orgues: à droite, la chaire: une simple tribune de
pierre, de forme hexagonale légèrement surélevée. Un
balcon court sur les deux côtes de la chapelle, dont le
fond est occupé par une tribune.”</p>

<p>The church is in a much better condition than
formerly. The congregation during my chaplaincy
put a new roof upon it, and decorated it throughout,
and constructed a handsome Mortuary Chapel
underneath—a sad necessity for the English and
American colonies in Paris. I conducted some
remarkable services during my time in Paris, which
I describe in another chapter—scenes which will not
soon be forgotten by those who witnessed them. I
was glad to leave behind some £7,000 which had been
subscribed towards a Church House, a much-needed
establishment, as there is no room for Church
purposes or residence for the chaplain. My successor,
the Right Rev. Bishop Ormsby, will, I hope,
reap the benefit of this effort.</p>

<p>His Gracious Majesty King Edward VII. was
several times in Paris during the earlier years of my
chaplaincy, as Prince of Wales, but his first visit to
the French Republic as King and Emperor was in
May, 1903. The visit was official and unique.
Those of us who had lived in Paris during the Boer
war—when, to say the least, the English were not
popular, and had so frequently heard “Vivent les
Boers” as we passed along the streets, and even
had newspapers flaunted before us which recorded
reverses to our arms—were very anxious that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
visit should pass off quietly. The English colony
was much concerned, and so were the French police.
I was advised by the latter to admit to the Church
only by ticket, and to take the names and addresses
of each applicant for them who might be unknown to
me. The following was the text of the ticket I
issued: “English Church, Rue d’Aguesseau.
Divine Service 11 a.m. It is requested that all seat-holders
will be in their places at 10 o’clock. After
10.30 all unoccupied seats will be filled.” The
tickets were all numbered and signed with a special
stamp marked “Basileus.” The issuing of these
tickets gave us considerable work, as we only had
1,000, and some 1,500 to 2,000 people applied for
them—many by letter. Nearly the whole of two
days was occupied in the distribution.</p>

<p>The “Entente Cordiale” is now happily a “fait
accompli”; but at the time of His Majesty’s first
official visit there was no thought of it in the public
mind, though we know now it was the gracious intention
of our peace-loving King that it should come
about. I give an excerpt from the “Patrie,” signed
by M. L. Millevoye, which at this time gave us some
concern, for the “Patrie,” while not a high-class
paper, is one that is largely read by the man in the
street:</p>

<p>“Parisiens! Le Roi des Anglais n’est pas votre hôte:
ce n’est pas vous qui l’avez invité. Cet étranger, cet
ennemi vous impose sa visite.… Parisiens, ce
roi vous saluera, vous ne le saluerez pas.</p>

<p>“Mais des cris bien français, esclusivement français,
peuvent sortir, sans provocations, de vos poitrines.
Crier ‘Vive Marchand!’ c’est condamner Fachoda,
c’est marquer la flètrissure d’une des plus hyprocrites<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
d’une des plus odieuses brutalités diplomatiques que la
France aie subies, Crier Vivent les Boers.… Crier
Vive la Russie.… Votre silence même, s’il est
général, absolu, aura sa grandeur. Devant vos fronts
couverts, devant vos regards implacables, ce roi
comprendra qu’on l’atrompé en lui parlant de votre
soumission, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c.”</p>

<p>It seemed, however, as if the very presence of
His Majesty in Paris at once dissipated any cloud
that might have appeared in the sky. The French
are remarkable for their readiness to swing round to
an opposite opinion when they find reason for so
doing. This was very striking in the Dreyfus affair,
and, more recently, in the case of M. E. Zola,
who, after having been condemned to imprisonment
and a heavy fine for his defence of Dreyfus,
received the “post mortem” honour of being
removed from the cemetery of Montmatre to the
Panthéon, that resting place of the illustrious French
dead.</p>

<p class="caption">HIS MAJESTY ENTERING THE CHURCH, FOLLOWED BY SIR E. MONSON.</p>
</div>

<p>The visit of His Majesty to Paris extended from
May 1st to 4th, and almost every hour was occupied
with the usual official visits, lunches, dinners, and
receptions. The English colony looked forward especially
to the Sunday when they expected to see and
worship with the King in their own Church. There
was some anxiety as to whether His Majesty would
sit in the Embassy gallery, or in the body of the
Church, as in the former case he would hardly be
seen by the congregation. I reported to our Ambassador,
Sir E. Monson, the great desire that the
King would sit with the congregation, and late on
Saturday evening I received a message that he had
kindly consented to do so. This gracious act gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
much pleasure to the colony. There were many
young people who had never seen their King before,
and I fear his presence was rather distracting to their
worship on this occasion.</p>

<p>The police were considerably scared when it was
announced that His Majesty would not drive to the
Church, but intended to walk. Although only a few
yards it was felt to be more or less a danger; but
every precaution being taken, all passed off safely.
As the congregation was assembling, I was sent for
to the door to interview a distinguished-looking man
who desired to enter the Church, but had no ticket.
I found, however, upon careful enquiry, that he
was a detective from Scotland Yard, and required to
examine the place where the King was to sit.</p>

<p>This quiet Sunday service, with the King-Emperor
attending as an ordinary worshipper, very
much impressed the French people. I will quote
what was said by the “Figaro” and the “Daily
Telegraph” at the time; the former giving the
general French feeling much more accurately than the
“Patrie,” although even the latter paper soon
changed its tone.</p>

<p>The “Figaro” thus describes the service:—</p>

<p>“Les Parisiens sceptiques et volontiers gouailleurs,
ont été fortement impressionnés par la très simple
cérémonie d’hier matin, la plus grande peut-être de ces
trois jours de fête. De la rue Royale à l’avenue de
Marigny dix mille curieux descendent tout endimanchés
des faubourgs, se massent aux abords de l’Ambassade
d’Angleterre, pour voir comment le roi de
la Grande-Bretagne et d’Irlande et des possessions
britanniques d’outre-mer, défenseur de la foi, empereur
des Indes va faire-visite à Dieu. C’est à pied que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
S. M. Edouard VII., en tenue de ville, se rend à
l’Eglise. Et quand il le voit passer ainsi, tout ce
peuple saisi d’émotion, chapeau bas, s’incline, dans un
silence solennel. La petite Eglise gothique de la rue
d’Aguesseau regorge de monde. On a lancé neuf cent
trente invitations. La nef, les galeries, les bas-cotés,
les tribunes, tout est bondé.</p>

<p>“Les deux premières travées de banquettes sont
réservées; et devant elles, à gauche du chœur un
fauteuil recouvert de velours rouge, avec un prie-dieu
sans appui, et un pupitre sur lequel sont deposés une
Bible, et un livre de psaumes, marque la place du
Roi.… Le Pasteur et ses assistants ont la
soutane et le surplis garni de bandes de satin noir et
rouge. Les enfants de chœur assis près de la chaire,
ont seulement la soutane noir et le surplis. Sur un
signe du secrétaire qui guettait à la porte l’arrivée du
Roi, tout le clergé, le Rev. Dr. Noyes en tête, se porte
au-devant de sa Majesté et l’attend sur le seuil.
Edouard VII. et le Pasteur se saluent en même temps.
Le Clergé remonte vers le chœur, précédent le
Souverain, que suivent les membres de l’Ambassade
d’Angleterre et tous les attachés militaires. Et des que
S. M. Edouard VII. a pris place devant son fauteuil—et
ouvert son livre de psaumes, l’office divin commence.
Les fidéles, dont un instant très court de curiosité n’a
pu troubler le recueillement, entument en anglais le Te
Deum. Puis les hymnes, les versets de la Bible, les
psaumes se succèdent chantés par toute l’assistance.
Les fidèles s’agenouillent, et le Roi s’agenouille comme
eux; et sa voix se mêle avec leurs voix. Il n’y a plus
un souverain et des sujets, ‘Il n’y a qu’une famille dont
tous les membres s’addressent, ensemble au Père,
‘Notre Père qui êtes aux cieux.’ C’est la prière que<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
nous ne savons plus. Enfin les chants ayant cessé le
Rev. Dr. Noyes se lêve et prononce le sermon
dominical. Pendant un quart d’heure environ, il
développe la thèse de la Divinite du Christ, et l’office
termine, selon l’usage, par un dernier cantique, sans
qu’aucune allusion, ainsi qu’il en avait exprimé
lùi-même le désir, aie été faite à la presence du Roi.”</p>

<p>I have given the above in full as it is an interesting
French view of an English church service.</p>

<p>“The Daily Telegraph” recorded this event of
the day as follows:</p>

<p>“At the morning service in the English Church,
Rue d’Aguesseau, the King was attended by his
suite, and accompanied by Sir E. Monson and the
staff of the Embassy. This sacred edifice is a
building of great interest to English residents in
Paris. The Rev. H. E. Noyes, D.D., has been
Chaplain to the Embassy since 1891, and during that
incumbency has known three eminent representatives
of the Empire, Lord Lytton, the Marquis of Dufferin,
and Sir Edmund Monson. Our compatriots in the
French capital do not forget their Church. It is
surely a matter of pleasure to know that at the last
Easter celebrations there were no fewer than 930
communicants. To-day the Church was all too
small. Though admission was necessarily by ticket,
a crowd besieged the doors more than an hour before
the beginning of the service. Notre Dame or the
Madeleine would have been insufficient for the congregation
anxious to be present. Indeed, one feels
regret for the hundreds who failed to obtain a coveted
ticket of admission. Practically small room was left
after seats had been found for the regular congregation,
among whom I was pleased to note a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
number of English young ladies attending Parisian
schools. Many a year hence it will be a pleasant
memory for those young persons who participated in
this historic service. ‘What a noble national possession
is England’s “sublime liturgy,”’ to quote
George Borrow’s description of it.</p>

<p>“Who has not felt its impress in a foreign land?
I have heard it west of the Rocky Mountains, under
the Stars and Stripes, beneath the Southern Cross, in
the capital of China, on the Indian, the Atlantic,
and the Pacific Oceans, and in war time in South
Africa, and the effect is everywhere the same—a
finer patriotic glow than almost anything else can
call up. It appeals to one as part of the heritage of
the English people, like their old Parish Church, or
their very language itself. In the Rue d’Aguesseau
the prayers for the King and the Royal Family of
Great Britain were followed, as they always are here,
by petitions for the Presidents of the United States
and of the French Republic. The ‘Te Deum’ was
finely rendered, as were the hymns ‘Children of the
Heavenly King’ and ‘The King of Love my shepherd
is.’ Dr. Noyes founded a short, eloquent discourse
upon Matthew xiii. 54, 55.”</p>

<p>As the King left the Church the congregation
sang the National Anthem with a fervour and
emotion, which was natural upon such an occasion.</p>

<p>After lunching at the Foreign Office with that
eminent statesman, M. Delcasse, His Majesty
returned to the Embassy. Here a most interesting
ceremony was held. The King had promised to plant
a red chestnut tree in the Embassy garden, and the
children of the British schools, to the number of fifty,
and the inmates of the Victoria Home (an institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
for aged British women who have lived in France for
thirty years) were invited to be present. It was a
memorable occasion. The King handled the spade
as one accustomed to it, and the tree thus planted
has flourished remarkably well ever since. It bears
a plate stating the date, etc., and will, no doubt, be
an object of interest in the beautiful garden of the
Embassy for many years to come. The King has a
wonderful memory for old friends. I heard him on
this occasion asking kindly after the Hon. Alan
Herbert, M.D., whom he had known in Paris many
years ago. Another interesting incident took place
on this afternoon. Among those invited to the Embassy
garden was an old soldier, George Colman,
nearly ninety years of age, who had been
dispatch writer to Lord Raglan in the Crimean
War. He was presented to the King, who
had a long chat with him, and asked him
“Where are your medals?” Colman replied, “Your
Majesty, they were stolen from me at the time of the
Paris Commune.” “Well,” said the King, “we
must see to that.” Colman was not forgotten, and
not long after the medals were received at the
Embassy. He brought them to shew to me in great
delight.</p>

<p>In the evening a large official dinner was given
at the British Embassy, which was attended by the
President and Madame Loubet, members of the
French Government, and many other distinguished
guests. Three French artists had the honour of
being invited, MM. Carolus-Duran, Detaille, and
Bonnat. The City was brilliantly illuminated, and
presented all the characteristics of a National fête.</p>

<p>His Majesty left Paris for Cherbourg the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
morning, President Loubet accompanying him to the
Gare des Invalids. There was a thankful sigh of
relief from the many loyal hearts in Paris that all had
passed off so well, and that our beloved Monarch was
safe. It had been an anxious time, for the happy
change to more friendly relations between the two
countries had then only just commenced.</p>

<p>The next visit of His Majesty was in May, 1905,
just two years after his first official visit. There had
been a change at the Embassy. Much to the regret
of all who knew him, Sir Edmund Monson had
retired, having reached the age limit, and had been
succeeded by Sir Francis Bertie, the present Ambassador.
There was, moreover, a great change in the
attitude of the people, and the “Entente Cordiale”
was on the lips of all. The King’s previous visit,
and the return visit of M. Loubet to London, resulted
in the settling of several outstanding disputes which
had long been an anxiety to diplomatists. There was
much less ceremonial upon this visit, and the King,
instead of going to the Embassy, took his old suite of
rooms at the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome,
where he had often stayed as Prince of Wales. His
Majesty came to Paris via Marseilles, where he had
a very hearty reception, and arriving at the Gare de
Lyon was met by Sir Francis Bertie and the staff of
the Embassy, and that all-important functionary, the
Prefect of the Police. A good number of people
gathered in the Place Vendome in the hope of seeing
the King, but the weather was showery, and he drove
in a closed carriage, and they were disappointed. The
Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome—formerly a
monastery—is managed by an Englishman, Mr.
Morlock, who is well known to many crowned heads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
The Tsar of Russia stayed there before his accession
to the throne; the late King and Queen of Portugal,
and many others. Mr. Morlock is a most genial
host, and although he has been so long in France
is proud of his nationality, and always ready to join
in any movement for the good of the British colony.
I had been informed that His Majesty would attend
Divine Service on the Sunday morning, and took the
precaution to admit only by ticket, to prevent over-crowding.
It was well I did so, for a great crowd
assembled outside the Church, and would have prevented
the regular worshippers from entering.
Owing to this arrangement the Church was filled
before the hour of service, and there was no confusion.
It was Eastertide, and the hymns “Jesus
lives! no longer now—Can thy terrors, death, appal
us” and “Hosanna to the living Lord” were sung
with great fervour. I had requested the congregation
to remain in their seats during the singing of
the National Anthem at the close of the service—the
intention being that His Majesty and the staff of the
Embassy would then leave and thus prevent
crowding at the door. However, the King stayed
until the end, and, I was told, joined heartily in the
anthem. We always omitted the second verse
having the words “Confound their politics,” as being
guests in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Upon this occasion His Majesty sat in the Embassy
gallery with Sir Francis Bertie and the staff. An
amusing incident happened as the King left the
Church. A loud crash was heard and caused some
excitement. It came from a photographer who had
perched himself upon a high ladder with a large
camera, hoping for a snapshot. He fell owing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
breaking of the ladder just as the King came out of
the porch. He was very disappointed at losing the
photograph.</p>

<p>Upon the return to the hotel the King received
Admiral Fournier, who had presided over the enquiry
relating to the North Sea firing incident, and conferred
upon him the insignia of a Knight Grand Cross
of the Victorian Order.</p>

<p>The reception of His Majesty on the part of the
people was in marked contrast to that of his former
visit. There were very few cries in the streets on
that occasion, but now one often heard “Vive le
Roi” and “Vive l’Angleterre” shouted with a
hearty good will. The “Entente Cordiale” was an
established fact.</p>

<p class="caption">HIS MAJESTY LEAVING THE EMBASSY CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>The third visit of the King during my chaplaincy
took place in March, 1906, when he travelled as the
Duke of Lancaster, arriving in Paris from Cherbourg
on the Saturday evening. The Royal train was
brought round to the Gare des Invalides, where the
King was met by Sir Francis Bertie and the staff of
the Embassy, M. Mollard representing the President
of the Republic, and M. Lepine, Prefect of Police.
As His Majesty ascended the stairs a flashlight
photograph of the scene was taken by an
unauthorised person—much to the annoyance of all
present, as the explosion caused a temporary alarm.
Next morning the King attended the Embassy
Church, and sat in the Royal gallery with Sir Francis
and Lady Feodorowna Bertie. Little change was
made in the service, except that I preached a short
sermon in order to keep within the limited time. My
text was “But the Word of God is not bound,” and
the collection was for the British and Foreign Bible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Society. H.R.H. Princess Henry of Battenberg and
the Princess Ena (now Queen of Spain) joined the
King at the Embassy for lunch. His Majesty drove to
and from the church in a closed carriage, and although
there was a great crowd, his desire to be “incognito”
was respected. It was upon this occasion that His
Majesty handed to M. Fallières the missing leaves
from the second volume of “The History of the
antiquities of the Jews” for the Bibliothéque
Nationale. M. Loubet, former President of the
Republic, was one of the many who called upon the
King, and it was characteristic of the kind feeling
of His Majesty that he returned the call at the private
apartment of M. Loubet—an act that was much
appreciated by the people generally. I often heard
French people speak of it. Upon this visit the
Embassy in the Faubourg St. Honore was turned into
a Royal Palace, the King and his suite staying there.
I was told of the following incident which indicates
the change of feeling on the part of the French.
After dinner at a fashionable restaurant (while the
King was in Paris) the band was called upon to play
the English National Anthem by a party of Frenchmen.
Then some Englishmen present called for the
Marseillaise, which was received with the same
honours and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>By a curious chance there was a party of Germans
present, and these stood up and uncovered while both
the National Anthems were being played. Beyond
the various social functions there was no other special
incident, and the short visit passed off very satisfactorily
in every way.</p>

<p>I have told of the enthusiasm evoked by the first
official visit of His Majesty to Paris, and the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
subsequent visits, but when it was reported early in 1907
that the King was coming, accompanied by the
Queen, enthusiasm knew little bounds. Many of the
English Colony had never seen the Queen, and were
on tiptoe of expectation. Their Majesties arrived in
Paris from London on Saturday evening, February
2nd, at the Gare du Nord, where they received an
enthusiastic—though non-official—welcome, for they
were travelling as the Duke and Duchess of Lancaster.
The photographic fiend was again in
evidence, and Her Majesty gave a perceptible start
as the magnesium light flashed, although she must be
accustomed to this annoyance. I was told that the
crowd outside the station was enormous, and the cries
“Vive le Roi—Vive la Reine” were very hearty,
both there and along the route to the British
Embassy, which was to be the temporary home of
their Majesties. Notwithstanding the fatigues of the
journey the King and Queen paid a visit to the
Nouveau Cirque in the evening, much to the delight
of those present.</p>

<p>It appeared to me that the Parisians were the
more pleased at the “incognito,” as it was as if
their Majesties came as friends, and not merely as
Royal visitors. The visit was thus less formal
yet more cordial; everyone felt that it was not
political, but just friendly, and Paris was delighted.
The British sovereigns were going to spend a week of
pleasure, visiting and entertaining their friends, shopping
and motoring. The Rue de la Paix is always
attractive, but it seemed to surpass itself on this
occasion.</p>

<p>I was naturally very busy preparing for the
Sunday service. Tickets were quite necessary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the demand for them very great. We issued 1,000—our
utmost limit—and then came the pain of refusing
the hundreds who also desired to attend. I crave
pardon for giving the report of the service, written by
my friend Mr. Ozane, the well-known and valued
correspondent of the “Daily Telegraph.”</p>

<p>He wrote: “I have never seen a larger crowd in
and near the church in the Rue d’Aguesseau than
that which assembled there this morning. Admission
to the sacred edifice was by cards, of which a
liberal distribution was made, but any number of
persons who must have known that the chance of
finding a place was hopeless, had put in an appearance
nevertheless. The English colony had
mustered in full force, and there was a big gathering
of French friends as well. The footpaths close to the
Embassy and along the street leading to the Church
were crammed with well-dressed people—the fair sex
being strongly represented; and there they stood in
the brilliant sunshine, but bitterly cold wind, waiting
for their Majesties to pass. The King and Queen drove
to and from the Church in one of the Ambassador’s
carriages, and with Sir Francis Bertie and members
of their suite were conducted to the Embassy Gallery.
By the time they entered the Church was
thronged to repletion, all the arrangements made for
the accommodation of the congregation being, however,
excellent. The prayers were read by the
curate, Rev. W. Harrison, the lessons being read
and the sermon preached by the Rev. H. E. Noyes,
D.D., who is chaplain to the Embassy. Doctor
Noyes is well known as a very eloquent preacher, and
taking for his text the 14th verse of the 8th chapter
of St. Luke, part of the Gospel for the day, delivered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
an excellent discourse on the parable of the sower.
The choir, under the direction of Mr. Percy Vincent,
did itself full justice, and the congregation joined
heartily in the service, as it invariably does at
this Church, which has only one defect, viz., that
it is not large enough to accommodate all the worshippers
who would attend it, especially at a season
when so many English visitors are passing through
Paris. When the service was over it was scarcely
possible to make one’s way along the street, so dense
was the crowd.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon the King paid a visit to President
Fallières at the Elysée, which was returned later,
Madame Fallières accompanying the President to
make the acquaintance of the Queen. In the evening
their Majesties dined with their old friends Mr. and
Mrs. Standish.</p>

<p>The following is an extract, giving the French
impression of the Church service:</p>

<p>“L’Eglise était comble, bien qu’on n’y eût èté
admís que sur la présentation de cartes imprimées,
spécialement. L’Entrée des souverains y fut saluée
par de nouveaux vivats. Ils prirent place dans la
tribune de l’ambassade, a gauche de la nef. Puis le
service commença. C’était l’office ordinaire du
dimanche et la seule modification qu’on y apporta fut
l’exécution du ‘God save the King’—joué par les
orgues à la fin de la cérémonie, tandis que tous les
assistants chantaient en chœur. Le Reverend H. E.
Noyes officie. Edouard VII. suit avec une attention
soutenue l’office, ainsi d’ailleurs que la reine Alexandra.”</p>

<p>All through the week the liveliest interest was
taken in the movements of the King and Queen, and
there were some amusing incidents. There was great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
curiosity to see the King’s automobile, the people
apparently having forgotten that he had purchased it
in Paris on a previous visit. What they expected to
see I don’t know—perhaps some vehicle modelled
after the old Royal stage coaches? But the reality
was a fine Mercédés car, much the same in outward
appearance as others in Paris, but with luxurious
interior fittings. It was the rule in France at this
time (as since) to have a conspicuous number painted
on each car, and this mark the Royal Mercédés had
not. It was consequently very soon stopped by a
policeman in the Champs Elysées, and a crowd
gathered. When, however, it was found to have a
Royal owner, it was allowed to pass on. But this
was not the end of the matter. Next day it was
stopped by a more “exigeant” police officer, who,
having failed to get satisfactory answers from the
English chauffeur, obliged him to go to the police
station. The crowd was highly amused as the news
soon spread “C’est l’automobile du Roi,” although
the stern police officer continued to ignore it. I
believe there was another difficulty the following day.
However, so soon as His Majesty heard of his
chauffeur’s adventures, he ordered a number to be at
once painted on the car, to conform with the French
law.</p>

<p>Her Majesty the Queen received many begging
and other letters during her short stay, and I was
struck by the careful enquiries she caused to be made
about each case. I was glad to be able to give,
through one of the attachés, information as to several
of the applicants who were well known to me.</p>

<p>The consideration of the Parisians for the
“incognito” of their Majesties was very marked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
It was reported that both the King and Queen
expressed their satisfaction at this, and that the
former said “Nothing could be nicer or more discreet.
The Parisians are the most courteous people in the
world.” The same attitude was maintained all
through the visit, enabling their Majesties to go about
in freedom and comfort, as they constantly did, to
the great delight of both nationalities in the gay city.</p>

<p>After the “Entente Cordiale” became an accomplished
fact, we had several visits of public bodies to
Paris, and I always endeavoured to arrange a special
service for them as part of the programme of the
visit. In November, 1903, we had a British Parliamentary
visit. I had corresponded with the secretary
beforehand, and arranged for a special service at
4 p.m. on the Sunday afternoon (29th). We had no
room for them at the ordinary morning service. I
also consulted Sir E. and Lady Monson, who kindly
arranged their reception for 5 o’clock, so that the
Members of Parliament, their wives, and daughters
could go across to the Embassy at the close of the
service. About 300 attended, and, I had reason to
know, fully appreciated the arrangement that had
been made for them. I preached upon the Great
Charter of our Religious Liberty from the text
“Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar’s,
and to God the things that are God’s.” The
National Anthem was very heartily sung at the close.
Sir E. and Lady Monson received the guests with
their usual kindness, and all the magnificent rooms
at the Embassy were thrown open to them. All the
members of the British party were present, together
with French Senators and Deputies, and the leading
members of the British Colony in Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>This same year we had a visit from the present
Bishop of London. I believe his first visit as Bishop.
I had written to him to say that I had a number of
candidates for confirmation (about 50), but that our
own Bishop Wilkinson, coadjutor for London, could
not come, and could he ask some other Bishop who
might be in London to take the office for us. He
wrote: “My dear Noyes, I will come myself.” The
British Colony will not soon forget his visit. After the
Confirmation, at which he gave a most helpful address,
although curiously enough founded upon a misquotation,
we had a reception at my house, which was
attended by the leading members of the Colony, and
those confirmed, with their parents and friends. The
Bishop (as always) won the hearts of all by his kindness
and geniality. I acted as His Lordship’s chaplain
while he was in Paris, and he kindly fell in with
all the arrangements I had made, which were
numerous.</p>

<p>In February, 1906, we had a visit from the
London County Council, most of whom attended the
ordinary service in the Embassy Church on February
4th. On Monday (5th), there was a grand reception
at the Hotel de Ville. This magnificent structure,
erected on the site of the old historic building, is well
worth a visit. The decorations and pictures are
among the most beautiful in Paris, and when it is lit
up and specially decorated with flags, etc., as it was
on this occasion, presents a striking scene. The
same week the “Minister of the Interior,” an office
corresponding to that of our Home Secretary, gave a
grand reception in his superb mansion in the Place
Beauveau. All the London County Council were
invited, together with the leading members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
British Colony. The reception was followed by a
concert, in which some of the best known artists in
Paris took part. The programme was itself a thing
of beauty, bearing in the front a striking picture
drawn for the occasion by Lévy, of a sailor looking
back over a tempestuous sea at a lighthouse on a
pier.</p>

<p>This was a year of visits. In October, the Right
Hon. Sir Walter Vaughan-Morgan, Lord Mayor of
London, accompanied by many of the City Fathers,
came officially to Paris. There was considerable
excitement among the citizens of Paris about this
visit, for among other things it was rumoured that
the Lord Mayor would bring his state carriage, and
also Mr. Wright, his well-known coachman, whose
fame had preceded him. An enormous crowd
gathered to welcome the party, many leaving off
work early in order to see them pass, and the streets
from Gare du Nord to the Rue Scribe were literally
packed with people. The cheers were frequent and
loud, and one often heard, “Vivent les Anglais,” and
the less common “Vive le lor Maire.” Had this
cry ever been heard before in Paris? Mr. Wright,
the coachman, had reached Paris the day before, and
was soon recognized on the box of the Lord Mayor’s
carriage. The crowd shouted, “Vive Monsieur
Wright,” and “Vive le cocher du lor Maire” with
vehemence, evidently delighted with his jolly appearance.
I had corresponded with Sir Joseph Savory
with reference to a service in the Embassy Church on
the Sunday, and it was decided that a gallery (holding
about 100) should be placed at their disposal, although
this caused the other parts of the building to be very
crowded. In front of the Embassy, which faces the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Rue d’Aguesseau, and down the street, police were
stationed in force. Had the King himself been
coming there would hardly have been a stronger
detachment. The whole of the gallery in the Church
was filled. The Lord Mayor was invited to a seat in
the Embassy gallery. I preached a special sermon to a
very attentive congregation upon the labour question.
After Divine Service the Lord Mayor and members of
the party lunched at the Embassy with Sir Francis
and Lady Feodorowna Bertie. In the afternoon the
Lord Mayor, accompanied by Sir George Faudel
Phillips, Sherriffs Dunn and Crosby, Sir Joseph
Savory, and Sir Vesey Strong, paid a visit to the
Girls’ Friendly Society. There is usually a large
attendance of girls on Sunday afternoon, but on this
occasion the hall was crowded in every part. In
introducing the Lord Mayor, I explained the objects
of the Society, and told something of its good work
in Paris. In reply Sir W. Vaughan-Morgan said
“He had not expected to find the members of the
Society so numerous in Paris. He did not know if
he were breaking the rules in paying them a visit,
but as Dr. Noyes had brought him in, he also hoped
he would find some way of getting him out.” Sir
George Faudel Phillips also said some kind words
to the ladies and members present. The drives of
the civic party in the City in the days that followed
were a great delight to the people crowding the
streets. I was on the Boulevards on one occasion
when the carriages passed, and the remarks of the
people at the unusual dresses, and especially the
head gear of some of the party, were most amusing.
I understand the principal carriage was not brought
as it was too large for the railway vans! The Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Mayor and Corporation very kindly gave me 100
guineas as a memento of their visit, towards the proposed
Church House in connection with the Embassy
Church—a much-needed institution—part of which
will form a club for young British men, and the
whole be a centre for church work.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BRITISH EMBASSY.</span></h2>

<p>I lived and worked in Paris during the “reign”
of five Presidents of the Republic and four British
Ambassadors. When I went abroad M. Sadi Carnot
was President. He was assassinated at Lyons in June,
1894, by the Italian Anarchist Caserio Santo. When
I left Paris President Fallières had lately come to
the Elysée. The interest of the British Colony
largely centres in the British Embassy, and the residence
of the Ambassador in the Faubourg St.
Honoré has been the scene of many notable
gatherings. The house itself is a very attractive
one, with beautiful gardens extending at the back
to the Champs Elysées. It is said to have been
built after the design of Mazin, in the eighteenth
century, and was originally inhabited by the Princess
Pauline Borghése. It may be interesting to some
to know that pieces of the Borghése furniture still
remain in the Embassy, notably the handsome bedstead.
His Majesty the King occupied this when
staying at the Embassy. Some beautiful Empire
clocks are to be seen in the reception rooms, and are,
I understand, unique and very valuable.</p>

<p>It was in the time of the Duke of Wellington that
the property was purchased for the English Government.
The price said to have been paid was 625,000
frs., a comparatively small sum. It has proved a
profitable investment, as property in this part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Paris has greatly increased in value. It is estimated
that the property is now worth six millions of
francs (£240,000). The following is, I believe, a
complete list of the Ambassadors who have resided
there:—1816, Sir Charles Stuart; 1825, Viscount
Granville; 1829, Lord Stuart de Rothesay. During
the reign of Louis Phillipe, Henry, Lord Cowley,
and then the Marquis of Normanby, were at the
Embassy. 1852, Lord Cowley (son of the former
Ambassador); 1868, Lord Lyons; 1887, The Earl of
Lytton. Lord Lytton died in June, 1891, and was
succeeded by the Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, who
retired upon the age limit of seventy in 1896. He
was succeeded by Sir Edmund Monson, who also retired
from age, and the present occupant is the Right
Hon. Sir Francis Bertie, whose wife is a daughter of
Lord Cowley, the former Ambassador. I had intended,
with the permission of the Ambassador, to put a
board in the Embassy Gallery in the Church, recording
the above facts and dates, which would be
of great interest to many, but I put it off until too
late. Perhaps my successor may wish to carry out
this idea.</p>

<p>The success and comfort of the Chaplain in
his varied work connected with the Embassy
Church, naturally depends largely upon the support
and sympathy of the Ambassador and his family. I
desire to place it on record that during my sixteen
years’ work in Paris, nothing could exceed the kindness
and consideration which I received.</p>

<p class="caption">EARL OF LYTTON.</p>
</div>

<p>My first introduction to the Embassy was when
the offer of the chaplaincy came to me. There was
then a considerable debt upon the Church, which I
was required to undertake, and which caused me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hesitate. I was uncertain how far the Colony would
support me. I was advised to go over to Paris and
consult with Lady Lytton before I finally decided.
I did so, and was most kindly received. We talked
the matter over, and I related my difficulties, when
Lady Lytton said: “Come, and we will help you to
pay off this debt” (£600). Her Excellency promised
that she would organise a bazaar, which would
no doubt be sufficient. Soon after my arrival a
meeting was called and the matter put in hand, but alas!
before the sale could be held, the Earl of Lytton died.</p>

<p>It fell to Lady Dufferin—who kindly took the
matter up—to make her first public appearance as
Ambassadress, at the opening ceremony. The effort
proved most successful, the debt was paid, and a
balance remained which enabled me to put double
doors to the Church, which in the winter time were
most necessary. The Earl of Lytton was not a regular
Church goer. He used jokingly to say to me: “You
are so crowded I can’t get in”; but Lady Lytton
and her daughters were most regular, and generally
at both morning and afternoon services on Sundays.
Her Excellency took a great interest in the British
poor and in the various charities, especially in the
Victoria Home—paying frequent visits to the old
ladies—much to their delight.</p>

<p>It was a sad time in the English Colony when
the family left. Personally, we missed them
greatly, for we were frequently at the Embassy, our
children often played there, and in every way the
relationship had been most happy. It was a real
pleasure to us to receive several visits from Lady
Lytton subsequently in Paris, and to answer her kind
enquiries about friends in the Colony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>A change at the Embassy is always, for many
reasons, an anxious moment for the English colony.
It was with real pleasure that we heard the news
that the Earl of Lytton was to be succeeded by the
Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, who had been as part
of his memorable career both Governor of India and
Canada, and whose name was well known to all
English people. Lord and Lady Dufferin arrived in
Paris in March, 1892.</p>

<p>A hearty welcome was accorded to the Marquis
and his family, and it was soon felt that we had
in him, not only an Ambassador accredited to the
French Republic, but also one who realized his
responsibilities to the large Colony of British people
always to be found in Paris; and that in this attitude
he would be in every way supported by his
noble wife. As chaplain to the Embassy Church
I was most grateful for the kind reception and encouragement
I received from the day of their arrival
until their much regretted departure. It was delightful
to see the Embassy gallery in church
crowded the Sunday after their arrival, and to find
they took a lively interest in all religious and philanthropic
questions. I was at times during my chaplaincy
saddened by the too frequent neglect of the
ordinary Church services by the Churchmen on the
staff of the Embassy. Why is it that the Diplomatic
seems the exception, with respect to a general rule
in the public service of at least one attendance at
their own Church on Sundays? I had, however,
no reason to complain of the attendance during Lord
and Lady Dufferin’s time in Paris—the gallery was
invariably well filled. I suppose that after all it is
in this service, as in others, a matter of example. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is known, the Marquis of Dufferin suffered from
deafness in his later years. He used sometimes to
bring a book of sermons, which he read while I
preached.</p>

<p class="caption">COUNTESS OF LYTTON.</p>
</div>

<p>The Embassy was practically an open house
during this time, and the enthusiasm and devotion
of the British Colony remarkable. In May this
year a banquet was given in honour of the Queen’s
birthday, and was most brilliant. The leading
members of the Colony were invited. The banqueting
hall was decorated with trophies gathered from
many lands, and the table (as always) beautifully
arranged with flowers, and some of the many curios
the Marquis possessed from Canada, Burmah, India,
etc. It was part of my duty to say the Grace on
these occasions.</p>

<p>In November of the same year I received
a visit from my lamented friend, Lord Plunket,
late Archbishop of Dublin, and their Excellencies
the Marquis and Marchioness of Dufferin and
Ava honoured us by coming to meet him at
dinner. The late Canon Meyrick, the Bishop
of Clogher, and Père Hyacinthe Loyson were
also with us. It was a gathering preliminary
to a visit to Spain by Lord Plunket for the
consecration of a Reformed Church in Madrid. I
have said that the first public act of Lady Dufferin
was to open the Bazaar on behalf of the debt on the
Church, which she did in a telling little speech,
which made a most favourable impression upon all
present. But Her Excellency may be said to have
been always before the public in Paris. She found
time amid the onerous duties of the Embassy to visit
the various charitable institutions, and to organize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
help and give advice wherever needed. I remember
on one occasion she came to the meeting of the
British Charitable Fund, and sat for a considerable
time listening to the various tales of woe that came
before us. The applications to Her Excellency from
professional beggars were very numerous, but she
never gave help without careful enquiry, and I was
glad to be of frequent assistance to her in this
matter. The Victoria Home for Aged British
Women was regularly visited by Lady Dufferin and
her daughters, indeed, almost every week, and Her
Excellency knew all the inmates and the story of
their long life in France. She had no more devoted
admirers in the Colony. The Ladies Hermione
and Victoria Blackwood were ever welcome, and
spared neither time nor trouble to brighten and
cheer their lives. Photographs of the Dufferin
family hang in many of the rooms, and long after
they left the old ladies would make anxious and
loving enquiries about them. The Girls’ Friendly
Society, as I have stated elsewhere, owes its present
prosperous condition to the efforts of Lady Dufferin.</p>

<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE MARQUIS OF DUFFERIN AND AVA.</p>
</div>

<p>My predecessor, Rev. Howard Gill, realizing the
necessity of a central building where the various
Church works could be concentrated, and where also
much-needed rest and recreation rooms for young
men might be established, had ventilated the idea
of a Church House. There is no house or room of
any kind connected with the Embassy Church. An
influential meeting was held in the Mansion House
in London in furtherance of the project, but owing
to the debt on the church nothing had been done.
As this debt had been paid I felt we might move
forward, and consulted Lord and Lady Dufferin on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the subject. The difficulty was to commence a fund
when so large a sum (about £12,000) would be required.
Their Excellencies, however, advised me
to go forward, and promised me all the assistance
they could. Lord Dufferin kindly wrote me a letter
which I published with an appeal. A short time
after I was told by Lady Dufferin that they had
decided to allow a public sale in the Embassy on
behalf of the scheme. This proved to be a great
success. Lady Dufferin presided over a stall assisted
by the ladies of the Embassy, and the Ladies
Blackwood conducted a fish pond which was largely
patronized. The “clew” of the sale was an exhibition
in a private room of all the “curios” belonging
to Lord Dufferin, including a gilt filagree stand
and drinking cup, which had belonged originally to
the King of Burma. His Excellency took the most
lively interest in his own “show,” and never tired
going round to explain the various objects to the
visitors. The nett result of the sale was over
27,000 francs, and the fund was now fairly started;
it amounted to between seven and eight thousand
pounds when I left Paris. The house can now be
purchased, as the balance required can easily be
borrowed.</p>

<p>The thoughtful personal kindness I and my wife
received from Lord and Lady Dufferin is beyond
words to express. I may only give one or two
examples. There is no residence attached to the
Church, and as I was living some distance away it
was very difficult to get back after the eight o’clock
Communion Service on Sunday mornings for breakfast,
and be down again for Sunday School (held in
the Church) at 9.30. Lady Dufferin at once recognized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
this, and kindly offered me breakfast on Sunday
mornings at the Embassy. The rest was most
helpful, and I used to look forward to my meal in
the pleasant gallery looking out upon the garden—and
an occasional chat with Nowell, who waited upon
me—as a most pleasant break in the constant work
of Sunday. Nowell was the confidential servant of
Lord Dufferin for many years, who went with him
to Canada in 1872, and had been with him in all his
different posts.</p>

<p>A rather amusing incident once happened. The late
Archbishop of York was staying at the Embassy,
and we were invited to meet him at dinner on the
Saturday evening. While I was at breakfast on
Sunday morning he sent his servant down to ask me
the way to the other English church!</p>

<p>In 1893-4 my wife had a most serious illness, and
was confined to the house for some months. I can
truly say that scarcely a day passed without Lady
Dufferin coming in to see her, and often to sit with
her for a considerable time. Even when His
Majesty the King (then Prince of Wales) was in
Paris, and lunching at the Embassy, she did not
omit this kind office, but apologized for being late.
Such kindness can never be rewarded or forgotten.</p>

<p>Our relations with the French were not at this
time of the most cordial character, and I often feared
that His Excellency had a good deal of anxiety that
we knew nothing of—as, of course, we never spoke
of “politics” at the Embassy. I once, however,
ventured to say that I feared he had been passing
through a troublous time, and he took and held my
hand in his kind way and said: “My dear Noyes,
when one has been through the anxieties of Canada<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and India, it is not so difficult to support the trouble
here.”</p>

<p class="caption">THE MARCHIONESS OF DUFFERIN AND AVA.</p>
</div>

<p>But if the Embassy had its grave moments it had
its gay ones too. One morning, quite early, I received
a visit from apparently an old lady (really a
very young one), who told me she was in great
trouble. She seemed, however, very reluctant to
explain, and said she would like to see my wife. As
she was not down I proposed she could come later,
or, if she preferred, see me in the Vestry, where I
usually received such visits. After some demur she
promised she would. I learned later in the day that
it was one of the ladies from the Embassy—disguised.</p>

<p>She went from me to the Chancery, and equally
deceived one of the Attachés. The “make up”
was very clever, and I was quite deceived. We
were dining at the Embassy the same evening, and
His Excellency said, “I wish she had got a franc
from you, I should have put it on my watch-chain.”</p>

<p>We had a very enjoyable Christmas party at the
Embassy in (I think) 1894. Lady Dufferin had
arranged for a sort of magnified charade, in which
the family and most of the Attachés took part, and
in which they “took off” one another. The scene
representing the writing of a dispatch in the
Chancery was most amusing, the peculiarities of the
different secretaries were cleverly caricatured. I
was brought into the play, with some other members
of the Colony.</p>

<p>It was a happy coincidence that there were two
weddings in the Dufferin family during their stay
in Paris. These occasions were peculiarly interesting
to me, as I had been in the habit of giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
religious instruction to the younger members of the
family every week at the Embassy; and also that I
had known the Hon. W. Lee Plunket, who married
Lady Victoria Blackwood, for some years. His father,
the late Archbishop, was an intimate friend, with
whom I had travelled much in England, Scotland,
Ireland, Spain, and Portugal. The first marriage, that
of Lord Terence Blackwood and Miss Flora Davis,
took place on Oct. 16th, 1893. Miss Davis being an
American, the wedding took place in the Church of
the Holy Trinity, Avenue de l’Alma, Dr. Morgan
and myself being the officiating clergy. The church
was beautifully decorated, and well filled with guests,
both the English and American Colonies being
largely represented. In the seats reserved for distinguished
guests were Lord and Lady Dufferin, the
United States Ambassador (Mr. and Mrs. Eustis),
the Baron and Baroness de Morenheim from the
Russian Embassy, Mrs. J. H. Davis (stepmother of
the bride), with some other relations. After the
ceremony a reception was held at the British Embassy,
very numerously attended by both French
and English. The large number of handsome presents—under
the charge of Nowell—had many admiring
visitors. It was altogether a most interesting
and brilliant gathering, and the first marriage from
the Embassy for several years.</p>

<p class="caption">TRAINBEARERS AT THE LADY PLUNKET’S WEDDING.</p>
</div>

<p>The wedding bells were, however, heard again
when the Hon. W. Lee Plunket (now Lord Plunket,
Governor of New Zealand) was married in the
Embassy Church to Lady Victoria Blackwood,
daughter of their Excellencies Lord and Lady
Dufferin. The wedding took place on June 4th,
1894, and was a most interesting event. It had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
given out that the marriage would be of a semi-private
character. Notwithstanding, the church
was full to the doors. It was an interesting gathering
from both the family and public point of view.
Mrs. Rowan Hamilton, Lady Helen Ferguson, Lady
Terence Blackwood, Lady Hermione Blackwood,
and the Hon. Elizabeth and Olive Plunket (sisters
of the bridegroom), were present, and Miss Muriel
Stephenson and the Hon. Cynthia Lyttelton were
among the bridesmaids. In describing the bridal
procession, the “New York Herald” said: “The
noble Marquis, who wore the conventional frock
coat, appeared deeply moved as he led his beloved
daughter to the altar. In close order behind came
the eight bridesmaids in their light dresses and
broad hats, forming a very gay cortège, the rear of
which was brought up by a weeny mite of six years or
so in an ample Greenaway white skirt and mob cap,
and her brother equally diminutive, a jolly little
‘shaver,’ alert as he could be, his big blue eyes
taking in everything, dressed in white knickerbockers
and three-cornered white cavalier hat. How
sweet they were. Let me introduce them to you—Miss
Dora Geraldine Noyes and Master Claude
Noyes.” The latter, who had imbibed the idea that
this ceremony involved the departure of Lady
Victoria from the Embassy, for whom he had a great
admiration, was very indignant with Mr. Plunket,
and “went for him” later on in the Embassy garden.
It was a great pleasure to me to stand on this
occasion side by side with Lord Plunket (then Archbishop
of Dublin) and to assist in the marriage of
his son. The signatories of the marriage contract
were the Earl of Dufferin and Ava, Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Plunket (Archbishop of Dublin), Mr. F. Rowan
Hamilton, the Hon. David Plunket, and myself.
The reception after the ceremony in the Embassy
gardens was a brilliant gathering of “Tout
Paris.” M. Hanotaux (the newly appointed
Minister of Foreign Affairs) was among those present,
and the Diplomatic Corps were “au grand
complet.” Many American friends of the family
came to wish Godspeed and happiness to the young
couple. It was a happy gathering, and the fine old
garden—the scene of so many memorable gatherings—looked
its best.</p>

<p>In the Diplomatic service Ambassadors retire at
the age of seventy; there was real sorrow in the
English Colony in Paris when it was known that the
Marquis of Dufferin and Ava was nearing this
period. It being, however, inevitable, it was decided
to render their departure as little sorrowful as possible,
so far as the British Colony was concerned.
A Committee was formed to consider a presentation
to Lord Dufferin, and also a Committee of ladies,
who were anxious to mark their appreciation of Her
Excellency’s kindness and untiring work in connection
with the various charities. It was agreed to
present to the Ambassador a portrait of his son, Lord
Ava, who was also very popular, and M. Benjamin
Constant was commissioned to paint it.</p>

<p>It was unfortunately not ready for the day when
the presentation was made, but the subscribers were
invited to view it later. It is now, of course, of very
special value, owing to the unfortunate death of Lord
Ava in South Africa. At the banquet, when the
presentation was made, the Earl made a most interesting
speech, part of which is well worth recording.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
He said: “That he felt he was not addressing an
audience, but was speaking to a few dear and intimate
friends, and therefore would not make a set
speech. When one had something to say from one’s
heart words came easily. Considering the almost
minatory words in Scripture, addressed to those
who, like himself, had reached their seventieth year,
he hardly knew whether he might consider himself
as possessed of a future, or whether he ought not to
regard his life as over, and himself as an uninvited
guest at a crowded banquet. He consoled himself,
however, with the reflection that the words of Holy
Scripture were addressed to a people whose life began
rather earlier—who married, for instance, sometimes
at the age of ten, and whose girls were occasionally
mothers at that age. As he had not married till he
was thirty-six, he concluded that he was only now
beginning his life. Speaking as he did in the
British Embassy, he remembered what he felt at
his first appearance there. It was in that room
that he had ventured upon his first waltz,
having been ordered to dance. The lady was,
he feared, thoroughly disgusted with her partner.
In this room, too, he remembered a performance
of the ‘School for Scandal,’ in which three
of the characters had been taken by three descendants
of Sheridan—the Duchess of Somerset, his
mother, and Mr. R. Sheridan. Finally, the room
would be after this associated with one of the most
gratifying incidents of his life, the presentation of
this gift by his friends in Paris. He would like to
say a few words on his choice of the present. He
had desired something which might descend to his
heirs, and remain long afterwards as a memorial of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the kind feelings with which he had been regarded
in Paris. He had not chosen, therefore, a valuable
picture or other object which squandering descendants—such
persons were occasionally found in
families—would at once sell, but he had asked for
a portrait of his son which would grow more valuable
with time, and be a long-lasting memorial of his Paris
career. It would be among the most treasured of
the objects which he had collected at Clandeboy from
all parts of the world.”</p>

<p>The speech was delivered in the Earl’s happiest
vein, and was listened to with rapt attention,
though not without emotion, it being his last public
address to the British Colony in Paris.</p>

<p>The Colony, however, were not satisfied with
shewing their warm appreciation of the kindness of
their Ambassador. Lady Dufferin had won all
hearts during her stay by her consideration and
goodness to rich and poor. Almost every charity in
Paris had benefited from the indefatigable work of
Her Excellency, who had gone thoroughly into the
affairs of the various agencies and then set herself to
strengthen any that were weak. Never did she fail to
respond to any appeal, taking a personal interest in
every case, often at a sacrifice to the demands upon
her diplomatic duties. It was both a glad and a sad
gathering in the “Galerie des Champs Elysées” in
June, 1896, when the presentation committee and
a large gathering of friends met to say farewell to
their Ambassadress. The gift was a lovely Louis
XVI. clock and candelabras, and was presented on
behalf of the donors by the Hon. Mrs. Gye.</p>

<p>In reply Lady Dufferin said: “It is really impossible
for me to say what I feel on this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for I am quite overwhelmed by your kindness and
by your expressions of friendship and goodwill.
However undeserving of such kindness I may feel,
it is a very great pleasure to me to receive this assurance
of your sympathy. I thank you with all my
heart for your generous words, your good wishes,
and for this most lovely gift. I thank you also for
the many occasions upon which during the last three
years you have shewn your sympathy with other
members of my family, and for the loyal support you
have ever given me in all matters relating to British
charities in Paris. It is the duty, and I am sure it
is the pleasure, of every English Ambassadress here
to interest herself in these institutions, but without
the hearty co-operation of the British residents, her
fellow subjects, her interest in them could have no
practical result. If, therefore, I have been able to
promote in the slightest degree the welfare of any
British charity here, it is because of the unfailing
help and support I have received from you.”</p>

<p>Shortly after, the departure of Lord and Lady
Dufferin took place. It was a time and scene not
easily forgotten. The whole Embassy staff were
gathered in the hall, my wife and myself among
them. The Ambassador and Lady Dufferin came
down and went round to everyone, shaking hands
and saying goodbye. There were few dry eyes. No
ceremony marked their departure beyond this, and
they drove away in an ordinary “growler”—it was
just like them. Lord and Lady Dufferin returned to
Paris subsequently—for the Emperor and Empress of
Russia’s visit—but stayed at an hotel. I rarely met
Lord Dufferin afterwards. The last time was at the
cemetery at Mount Jerome, Dublin, when we stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
beside the grave of the late Lord Plunket. He then
laid his hand on my shoulder, saying: “Noyes, this
is a great deal out of your life;” and so it was, for
I had been intimate for many years with the Archbishop.
It has been our delight to welcome Lady
Dufferin on several occasions since.</p>

<p>The death of Lord Ava in South Africa, so deservedly
loved, was a great blow to Lord Dufferin, and
one of the sorrows which no doubt brought him to
the grave.</p>

<p>On that occasion he wrote me the following
letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“My dear Noyes,—</p>

<p>“I knew you would feel for us, and my wife
and I are deeply grateful to you and Mrs. Noyes for
the sympathy you have shewn us. We know no
details except that the telegram told us that our
poor boy died without having ever recovered consciousness
from the time he was struck. It is God’s
will, and we must try to submit in patience.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">“DUFFERIN AND AVA.”</p>

</div>

<p>The successor to the Marquis of Dufferin in Paris
was Sir Edmund Monson, Bart., who had held many
and important posts in the public service. He came
to the Faubourg St. Honoré in October, 1896, having
been Ambassador Extraordinary, and Plenipotentiary
to the Emperor of Austria since 1893. He was appointed
a Royal Commissioner for the Paris Exhibition
of 1900, and was made an honorary D.C.L. of
Oxford in 1898. He also received the Grand Cross
of the Legion of Honour from the French Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir Edmund and Lady Monson received a hearty
welcome from Parisians generally, and the Ambassador
soon won his way with us all by his kindly
manner and warm interest in whatever concerned
the British Colony. There were many important
events during the time Sir E. Monson was with us,
among which was the celebration of the Jubilee of
Queen Victoria, which took place in June, 1897. A
garden party was given at the Embassy, which was
very largely attended. The “Figaro” said there
were about four thousand present. The entire Diplomatic
Corps, artistic, political, and literary celebrities,
distinguished visitors to Paris, and the
leading members of the British Colony were included.
Madame Felix Fauré and Mlle. Lucie
Fauré, wife and daughter of the President, M.
Hanotaux, and many others well known in French
politics and society, were amongst the guests.
General Horace Porter, the American Ambassador,
was supported by a large number of the American
Colony. The following day a Children’s Fête was
held at St. Cloud. Special boats conveyed the young
Britishers to the rendezvous, and a most enjoyable
day was spent. Between eight and nine hundred
sat down to tea, when patriotic speeches were made
amid hearty demonstrations of loyalty to the Throne.
It is not an unimportant part of the chaplain’s work
to keep “green” in the hearts of the young living
in Paris the home feeling, and to prevent their slipping
away from attachment to their Sovereign.</p>

<p>The following year was marked by the
“Fashoda” incident, which, it will be remembered,
caused much excitement in both countries. Relations
were somewhat strained, and all sorts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
exaggerated rumours got abroad. I remember it being
reported that Sir E. Monson had gone to the Elysée
with an “Ultimatum” in his pocket; and again,
that the Embassy had commenced to pack up with a
view to removal! In December, 1898, the British
Chamber of Commerce gave a banquet, at which Sir
Edmund Monson made a speech which caused considerable
excitement. On arrival, I found the
journalists, who had seen a copy of the speech before
it was delivered, in a considerable flutter, M. Blowitz
of the “Times” being especially active. There was
marked silence during the delivery of the speech by
the Ambassador. The following is the most striking
passage: “I would entreat the French Nation to
resist the temptation to try to thwart British enterprise
by petty manœuvres; such as I grieve to see
suggested by the proposal to set up educational establishments
as rivals to our own in the newly acquired
provinces of the Soudan. Such ill-considered provocation,
to which I confidently trust no official
countenance will be given, might well have the effect
of converting that policy of forbearance from taking
the full advantage of our recent victories, and our
present position, which has been enunciated by our
highest authority into the adoption of measures,
which, though they evidently find favour with no
inconsiderable party in England, are not, I presume,
the object at which French sentiment is aiming.”</p>

</div>

<p>In February of the next year, President Felix
Fauré died quite unexpectedly. There was a certain
mystery about his death which has never been quite
cleared up to the public satisfaction. The wildest
rumours were spread in Paris. I visited the Elysée,
and the salon where the dead President lay. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
looked much as I had often seen him in life. He
was dressed in evening clothes, the prevailing custom
in France. The funeral was most imposing.
But “Le Roi est mort, vive le Roi.” Very soon the
question of a successor came on, and the grand Salon
at Versailles (where the German Emperor was
crowned in 1870) was filled with the deputies to elect
their President. The choice fell upon M. Loubet—contrary
to the expectation of many—and the event
showed that he was the right man, for during his
Presidency France had a comparatively quiet
period.</p>

<p>Next year (1900) came the great Exhibition,
when we were flooded with visitors from all parts of
the world. Sir Edmund Monson kindly placed the
ballroom at the Embassy at my disposal for an overflow
service on the Sunday mornings, as the church
proved too small.</p>

<p>Indeed, nothing could exceed the interest and
kindness of the Ambassador in all Church matters.
During this year the Annual Conference of Continental
Chaplains was held in Paris, as it gave them
the opportunity to visit the Exhibition. Halls suitable
for such a gathering were very expensive, but
again the Ambassador came to our aid, and we held
the Conference in the ballroom at the Embassy. He
also gave a banquet to the chaplains, which was
much appreciated. I unfortunately caught typhoid
fever at the end of the year, and so was debarred
from many of the closing functions which were
crowded into that time.</p>

<p>In 1901 came our great National loss in the death
of England’s greatest Queen. I have described elsewhere
the deep feeling manifested in the British<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Colony in Paris, and the services held in connection
with that sad event.</p>

<p>I have spoken above of the kindness of Sir E.
Monson in all Church matters. When the time of
his departure drew near, I wrote to tell him how
much the British Colony, and especially the congregation
of the Embassy Church, appreciated what he
had done. He wrote me the following letter:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“My dear Dr. Noyes,—</p>

<p>“I am deeply touched by your kind letter of yesterday;
and it is a real gratification to me to think
that our association during the last eight years has
been productive of such relations of friendship as
have constantly existed between us, and that our
steady co-operation in the interests of the English
community here has never failed to be advantageous.</p>

<p>“In the many posts which I have occupied in
Her Majesty’s service, it has always been one of my
chief pleasures to come into contact with the English
chaplains, and it has so happened that wherever I
have been I have had opportunities of making a
general acquaintance with all the accessible clergy.
I have had special experience of their devotion to
their work, and though differences of opinion are
inevitable, I have never found that such differences
have seriously interfered with social liking and harmony.
It has consequently been always a real
pleasure to my wife and myself to welcome the chaplains
whenever a general meeting calls them together
at the post we may be occupying. It is not so easy
at Paris as it is elsewhere to be in touch with a large
British community, but everyone with whom we
have made acquaintance has given us evidence of
interest for which we cannot but be very grateful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
We hope to be from time to time in Paris, and
whether we have a sort of home here or not, we shall
at any rate look upon the Rue d’Aguesseau Church
as a spot in which we have a vested interest, and
where we shall never be regarded as strangers.
With my wife’s very kind regards to yourself and
Mrs. Noyes, I remain, dear Dr. Noyes,</p>

<p class="center">“Most sincerely yours,</p>

<p class="right">“EDMUND MONSON.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sir Edmund Monson left us at the close of 1904,
to the sincere regret of all his friends. He was succeeded
by the present Ambassador, the Right Hon.
Sir Francis Bertie, K.C.M.G., etc., who came into
residence in January, 1905.</p>

<p>The staff at the Embassy is continually changing,
so that during my long chaplaincy in Paris I made
the acquaintance of many, and the friendship of
some now serving King and country in different parts
of the world. It would, I think, be difficult to find
in the public service a finer body of men than those
in Diplomacy.</p>

<p>The journalist has no doubt minimised to some
extent the work formerly done by the Diplomatist—as
Sir Edmund Monson pointed out in one of his
speeches. But the adjustment of international difficulties,
and the solving of delicate questions continually
arising—the “keeping of the buttons tight”—leaves
a vast amount of work with which Diplomacy
only can deal, and for which the careful technical
training for that service alone supplies the
knowledge.</p>

<p>One of the best-known figures at the Embassy
is Sir Henry Austin Lee, C.B., etc., who has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
many years attached to the Embassy, and is universally
loved and respected. He has had, as is well
known, a very distinguished career.</p>

<p>Among the many important appointments he has
held, it will be remembered that he was attached
to the late Marquis of Salisbury’s special Embassy
to Constantinople in 1876, and the special Embassy
during the Congress in Berlin in 1878, being assistant
private secretary to the late Earl of Beaconsfield.
He is now Commercial Attaché in Paris, and Councillor
of the Embassy, and also Director and member
of the Managing Committee of the Suez Canal Company.
Sir Henry Lee takes the warmest interest in
the British charities in Paris, and is Chairman of
the Schools and member of the Committee of the
British Charitable Fund. His marriage was the last
held in the Embassy. I officiated with his brother
at the ceremony. Her Royal Highness the Princess
of Wales (then Princess May) was present on the
occasion, and H.R.H. the Duke of Teck one of the
witnesses.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Ottley, Admiral Sir William May,
and Capt. Morgan were Naval Attachés during my
sojourn, and Major-General the Hon. Sir Reginald
Talbot, the late Lt.-Col. W. F. Bonham, and
Lt.-Col. H. C. Lowther, Military Attachés.</p>

<p>Sir E. Egerton (who has just left Rome), the late

Madrid), Sir Rennel Rodd (lately appointed to

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="smaller">MEMORABLE SERVICES.</span></h2>

<p>During my chaplaincy there were several memorable
services in the English Embassy Church. The first
of these was the funeral of the late Earl of Lytton,
Her Majesty’s Ambassador of France.</p>

<p>Lord Lytton died in November, 1891, at the
Embassy. His death was unexpected and sudden.
Upon hearing the sad news I called at the Embassy
and saw Lady Lytton, who was naturally very much
affected. I remember that she took me by the hand
and led me into the chamber of death, and we both
knelt down, and I prayed with her. The Earl was
very little changed by death, and lay as if asleep.
Each morning afterwards, until the funeral, I went
to the Embassy and conducted family prayers. The
relatives had gathered, and I had quite a large
number. Several of the Balfour family were present,
amongst whom was Lady Betty Balfour, the eldest
daughter of Lady Lytton, who has since, as is well
known, edited her father’s classic letters.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;" id="illus15">
<img src="images/illus15.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">BRITISH EMBASSY CHURCH, FROM THE RUE D’AGUESSEAU.</p>
</div>

<p>The funeral took place on Saturday, November
28th, and was most imposing. The late Earl was
very popular with the French, so much so that it had
been decided that the funeral must be public, and
of the “class” usually accorded to a Marshal of
France. The scene in the church was very remarkable.
The Embassy had taken the body of the
Church for the Diplomatic Corps and the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
officials of state of the French Republic. One gallery
was reserved for the special and intimate friends of
Lady Lytton, and the other gallery was the only
space available for members of the English Colony
generally. The body of the Church presented a striking
appearance. All the Foreign Ambassadors and
their suites were present in full diplomatic dress, and
the Military and Naval Attachés in their brilliant
uniforms. I remember that Colonel the Hon. R.
Talbot (as he was then) was especially remarked in
his English scarlet dress. The French Government,
the Political, Naval, Military, and Civil Administrations
were all represented, and many of the most
distinguished men in art, science, and literature had
come to pay the last tribute to the deceased
Ambassador.</p>

<p>The outer coffin was quite plain, in accordance
with Lady Lytton’s desire, and bore the inscription
“Edward Robert, First Earl of Lytton, born November
8th, 1831, died November 24th, 1891.”</p>

<p>The British Chamber of Commerce and the Hon.
Whitelaw Reid had sent flowers (evidently not
knowing of the order “No flowers”), but the only
emblem in the Church was a simple wreath of laurel,
which rested on the coffin. The Church was draped
from ceiling to floor in black and silver, and the effect
was very striking.</p>

<p>I have a record by me of some of those who were
present, and it is an interesting list of names. There
was the Prince of Monaco, M. Ribot (with the staff
of the French Foreign Office), General Brugère, M.
Fallières (then President of the Senate), MM. Jules
Ferry, Léon Fay, Goblet, and Flourens. Then I
saw Barons Alphonse Gustave and Edmund de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Rothschild, Comte Armaud, Prince de Sagan, the
Marquis de Breteuil, Alexandre Dumas, the Marquis
de Jaucourt, and Comte de Portales. These are but a
few of the well-known French names. In the
gallery amongst many others were the Baroness
Morenheim (wife of the Russian Ambassador at that
time), the Countess Hoyos, Madame and Mlle. de
Freycinet. I heard that amongst others a telegram
of sympathy was received from Madame Sarah
Bernhardt, who was in America. The pall bearers
were the Count von Munster (the German Ambassador),
Mr. Egerton, C.B. (Minister Plenipotentiary
at the British Embassy), Sir E. Blount (representing
the English Colony). M. Ribot (French Minister of
Foreign Affairs), and MM. Jules Claretie and
Camile Doucet, representing literature and science.</p>

<p>I shall never forget the scene in the streets. It
had been arranged that the body of the late Earl
should be taken from the Church in Rue d’Aguesseau
to the Gare St. Lazare, to be conveyed to England.
All the traffic was stopped between the Church and
the railway station, and the streets were lined with
military and police, and many thousands of spectators.
It was said that 3,000 soldiers were
employed, and that the procession took thirty
minutes to pass any given spot. The demeanour of
the immense crowd in the streets was most respectful
and sympathetic, and all heads were bared as the
coffin passed.</p>

<p>When we arrived at the railway, the hearse drew
up at the entrance gate, and then followed a most
impressive demonstration. I, with the other clergy
and the sons of the deceased Ambassador, stood in
front of the hearse; grouped round were the Ambassadors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
and State Officials, and now the entire body of
the French troops filed past in review order and
saluted the bier. I noticed that as the regimental flags
were borne past, the Military Attachés saluted them
and the civilians uncovered. The interment took place
at Knebworth. We had a memorial service in Paris,
and I made reference in the sermon to the distinguished
services of the late Ambassador, and by
request of Lady Lytton the sermon was published.</p>

<p>It was said at the time that the Earl of Lytton
was the first Ambassador who had died at his post
in Paris, but this is, I believe, not quite correct, as
James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, was Ambassador
for Queen Mary and King James I. at the
French Court, and he died in Paris in 1603.
Curiously he was known as Jacques de Bethune de
Balfour—the name Balfour being thus common to
both families.</p>

<p>But a few weeks afterwards, and a second
impressive and public service for the burial of the
dead was held in the Embassy Chapel, this time as
a memorial to the Duke of Clarence and Avondale.
His early death had evoked a world-wide sympathy,
and Her Majesty’s Chargé d’Affaires in Paris, Mr.,
now Sir E. H. Egerton, requested a public service.
Upon this occasion the gorgeous diplomatic and
military uniforms were not worn, as etiquette only
prescribes the wearing of uniform at a funeral service
in the case of a reigning sovereign, or of an Envoy
Plenipotentiary. This fact, however, did but add
to the solemnity of the scene. As was the case at the
funeral service for the Earl of Lytton, the body of the
Church was reserved for the French officials and the
Corps Diplomatique, while the unreserved part was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
filled with members of the British Colony, all the
ladies being dressed in mourning. The Church
chancel and pulpit was draped with black and silver
hangings, the porch outside being similarly decorated,
the Royal arms being emblazoned in the centre.
There was a large gathering of distinguished Frenchmen
on this occasion: President Carnot was represented
by Colonel Dalstein; the Prime Minister, M.
de Freycinet, by Colonel Pamard; the Minister of
Marine by Captain Thomas, of the Navy; and
General Saussier, Governor of Paris, by Colonel
Courbebaisse. M. Ribot, the Minister for Foreign
Affairs, was present, and among other Frenchmen
of prominence were M. d’Ormesson, Master of the
Ceremonies; M. de Mahy, Vice-President of the
Chamber of Deputies; M. Poubelle, Prefect of the
Seine; the Duc de Luynes, and the Duc de Mouchy.
Among the Diplomatic Corps I noticed Count Hoyos,
the Austrian Ambassador; Colonel de Fréedéricksz,
Military Attaché of the Russian Embassy; M. de
Schön, of the German Embassy; M. Delyanni, the
Greek Minister; Missak-Effendi, who replaced his
chief, Essad Pasha, kept at home by influenza; the
Baron de Almeda; M. Jusserand; Mr. Vignaud, of
the United States Legation; General Meredith Read,
and others. The members of the British Embassy
were present “au grand complet,” headed by Mr.
E. Egerton, Chargé d’Affaires, and Mr. Austin
Lee.</p>

<p>I conducted the service, assisted by my valued
colleague Rev. J. C. Pyper and two other clergymen,
and preached from the text “Weep with
them that weep.” Before closing I took occasion
to thank those of other Nations for their kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
expression of sympathy on the sad event. The
guests were received at the Church door by Sir
E. H. Egerton and Lt.-Col. the Hon. Reginald
Talbot, the British Military Attaché, as we had no
Ambassador yet appointed to succeed the Earl of
Lytton. Real sympathy was very manifest through
the whole service.</p>

<p>The following year (1893) there died in Paris a
remarkable man, Rev. Whitaker McCall, the founder
of the McCall Mission among the French people,
whom it was my privilege to know during the last
four years of his life. For twenty-three years this
devoted man had worked in the lowest parts of Paris
with remarkable success; so much so that in 1892 he
was accorded the Cross of the Legion d’Honneur by
the President of the French Republic as a mark of
appreciation of the work he had done. He was also
given the medal of the “Société libre d’Instruction et
d’Education populaires,” and that of the “Société
Nationale d’encouragement au Bien.” I believe he
was the only Englishman who has thus been
honoured, and this is the more remarkable as his
work was purely and altogether religious. The Salles
des Conferences scattered through Paris and the
Provinces are a lasting tribute to his memory, and
remain centres in which the work is still carried on.
The funeral was held in the Church of the Oratoire
in the Rue de Rivoli. A vast crowd filled the large
building in every part. This church is remarkable
from the fact that it was given to the French Protestants
by Napoleon the Great, and at one time—before
the Church in the Rue d’Aguesseau was bought—was
used for English Church services on Sunday evenings.
My friend Dr. Pigou, the Dean of Bristol, tells me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
that he frequently took services there when he was
connected with the old Rue Marbœuf Church.</p>

<p>I was asked to take part in the funeral service of
Mr. McCall, as representing the English Colony. It
was a scene not easily forgotten. The immense
crowd, the hymns sung in French, and the addresses—of
which I gave one, in both French and English—were
listened to with wrapt attention. It was the
last and a loving tribute to one who has probably done
more than any other to place the Word of God in the
hands of the French people.</p>

<p>The following year was marked by public services
of a different kind. It was the Diamond Jubilee of
our late Queen, of glorious memory, and the British
Colony in Paris—and there is none more loyal to the
throne—determined to mark it in a special manner.
Public meetings were held in the Hotel Continental,
kindly lent for the purpose, and it was decided to
raise a fund which, after deducting the expenses connected
with the fête, should be devoted to the various
British charities of Paris without distinction of creed.
It was also decided to give a fête to the children of
the Colony and a dinner to the working classes. I
consulted with Sir E. Monson, our Ambassador, who
arranged with me that there should be services held
in the Embassy Church corresponding with the
services in London on Sunday, June 20th. An
official service was also arranged for the afternoon of
the same day to which the Diplomatic Corps were
to be invited. The following is a description of the
services:—</p>

<p>“At the Embassy Church, in the Rue
d’Aguesseau, there were two thanksgiving services,
one at eleven a.m., at the close of which the Rev.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Dr. Noyes, who wore the scarlet cassock of a Doctor
of Divinity, delivered a touching and eloquent
address. He stirred a deep chord in the heart of
those who heard him by reminding them that,
though in a foreign land for the time being, they were
in communion of thought with millions of their countrymen
at home, and many more millions of their
fellow subjects in distant regions, even in the most
remote corners of the earth, in offering their thanksgivings
for the blessings the Queen’s reign had conferred
on England and the British people.</p>

<p>“The official thanksgiving service also took place
at the Rue d’Aguesseau, at three o’clock in the afternoon.
The admission to the church was by tickets,
as a large portion of the nave had to be reserved for
the French officials and the members of the Corps
Diplomatique; but the English community was also
present in large numbers, and the church was densely
crowded. The Corps Diplomatique, with the exception
of the United States Ambassador, whom
etiquette compels to wear evening dress on State
occasions, were all in full dress. Our Embassy
received the various officials and Diplomatists, and
showed them to their places. There were present, representing
England, Sir Edmund and Lady Monson
(the late), Mr. Gosselin, Colonel Dawson, Mr. Clarke
Thornhill, Sir Brook Boothby, Mr. Marling, Mr.
Barclay, Sir Berkeley Sheffield, the British Consul
General and Vice Consul, Messrs. Percy Inglis, and
Mr. Falconer Atlee. President Faure was represented
by the captain of the frigate Serpette, and the French
Government by M. Hanotaux and M. Mollard. The
German Ambassador and Countess Marie de Münster,
the Russian Ambassador and some of his Attachés<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
two of whom wore the splendid uniform of the
Chevaliers Gardes; the Austrian Ambassador, in
whose suite was a Hungarian magnate in a splendid
national dress, the Italian Ambassador, one of whose
Attachés was attired in the picturesque garb of
a Colonel of Bersaglieri; the Persian Ambassador,
Munir Bey, and his Staff, decked in gorgeous
uniforms, contrasting strangely with the unpretending
fez, which, of course, they did not remove;
the Chinese Ambassador and a couple of quaintly
dressed Mandarins, filled the nave of the unpretending
little church with a glittering array of gold
lace such as I think was never before congregated
within its walls. The rest of the nave and the
galleries were filled by the ticket-holders, and
they were all obviously English, ladies largely predominating.
The service was shorter than that in
the morning, but there was no sermon, and at the
close the choir sang the first and last verses of the
National Anthem, in which the English part of the
congregation joined. The Ambassador and his Staff
then took up places at the entrance of the nave, and
shook hands with the diplomatists and officials as
they passed out.”</p>

<p>There were some very striking testimonies in the
French papers to the Greatness of the Queen, e.g.,
in the “Gaulois,” M. Imbert de St. Amand wrote:—</p>

<p>“Queen Victoria has not only been a model
Sovereign, she has also been the model of all wives,
of all widows, of all mothers. She might be
described in a very few words—virtue on the Throne.
As a rule, long reigns generally end in sadness.
Charlemagne wept at the sight of the Northmen’s
galleys scouring the coasts. Charles V., weary and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
disheartened, sought the living death of the cloister,
and was present at his own funeral service. Louis
XIV. remarked to Marshal Villars after his last
defeat, ‘We cannot at our time of life hope for good
luck.’ None of these precedents holds good in the
case of her Britannic Majesty. Her reign, after sixty
years, seems to defy the efforts of time. There are
no signs of decay, but of a permanent renewal of
life. The popularity of the Queen grows with every
year added to her reign, and the joy and enthusiasm
with which her three hundred and fifty millions of
subjects acclaim it are the crowning and most
touching feature of her Diamond Jubilee. The
Queen fully merits this apotheosis, since she is the
noblest incarnation of all the leading qualities of the
Anglo-Saxon race—love of her home, firmness of
purpose, energy in effort, unswerving devotion to
duty. England sees herself mirrored in her Sovereign,
and takes just pride in the presentment.
She and her people are one.… Every class of
French society, without any distinction of party and
origin, unites in respectful greeting of the Sovereign
who stands out as the grandest womanly figure of her
century—the heroine of duty, whom not only her
children, but her whole people venerate as the most
intelligent, the most devoted, the best of mothers.
Like our neighbours, we shall all say, ‘God Save the
Queen,’ and with all our hearts take part in the
Jubilee, which is at once the triumph of the woman
and the triumph of the Queen.”</p>

<p>And again M. Comely in the “Matin”:—</p>

<p>“It is impossible for a civilized being to refrain
from a feeling of deep admiration at this splendid
result of the past sixty years. But it is difficult for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a Frenchman not to feel some bitterness when he
compares the situation of England with that of his
own country. Queen Victoria has known one King
of the French, one Emperor of the French, and six
Presidents of the French Republic. From her
steady, unchanging, Royal observatory, she has
beheld the rise and fall of eight Sovereigns! This
stability of England, compared with the instability
of France, is sufficient in itself to account for the
reason why France has been growing less while
England has been growing greater; the one has been
shrinking, the other has been expanding.”</p>

<p>The fêtes were a great success, and a grand testimony—if
it were needed—to the loyalty of Britishers
living in France. About fourteen hundred applied
for tickets. St. Cloud, a favourite suburb of Paris
on the Seine, and the Restaurant du Parc—the scene
of many British fêtes—were decided upon. Four of
the “Hirondelles” boats were chartered to convey
the party down the river. As each boat reached the
jetty, the band of the Pavilion Bleu, a well-known
restaurant, struck up the National Anthem. After
dessert the following telegram was read, which had
been sent by Sir E. Blount, then the “doyen” of
the Colony, to Her Majesty Queen Victoria: “We
your Majesty’s most loyal and loving subjects,
venture to offer our heartfelt congratulations on this
auspicious day, and pray for the continuance to your
Majesty of those blessings which have shed such a
lustre on your Majesty’s glorious reign.” The
following reply was received: “The Queen desires
me to thank you and Her British subjects in Paris for
your kind message and congratulations. Bigge.”</p>

<p>Mr. A. Percy Inglis, the highly-respected Consul-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
in Paris, made a patriotic speech. His proposal
of a toast to the Queen was received with the
utmost enthusiasm. I also made a speech on the
occasion, and took the opportunity of explaining the
history of the “Union Jack,” at which the audience
seemed greatly pleased. Paris joined heartily in the
celebrations, and the Rue de la Paix was a mass of
flags, and parts of the City were illuminated. The
English business houses all displayed flags in profusion.</p>

<p>In January, 1900, there was a remarkable
gathering in the Embassy Church at the funeral of
an English governess. It was the time of the Boer
War, and it was said that the well-known firm of
“Creusot” had supplied the guns which had done
such execution against us in South Africa. This
lady had been a governess in the family at the head
of the firm, and was greatly respected. The firm
paid all the expenses of the funeral, and attended
in such large numbers that the body of the church
was filled with men. It was a remarkable coincidence
that at such a time the English Church in
Paris should be filled with those who had, it was
understood, supplied the munitions of war used
against us, to pay a tribute of respect to a British
subject, the service being conducted by an English
clergyman.</p>

<p>In 1901 came that sad event which plunged the
Nation into mourning—the death of Her Majesty
Queen Victoria. The sympathy of the French
people with us in our sorrow was very marked. I
consulted with Sir Edmund Monson, our Ambassador,
who desired that special and official services
should be held in the Embassy Church at the time
of the funeral in England. The following account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of what was done in Paris appeared in the “Galignani
Messenger” of that date:—</p>

<p>“Rarely, if ever before, has the little church in
the Rue d’Aguesseau held a more august assembly
than it did yesterday morning, and the service, in
its grandeur and simplicity, was in every way suited
to the solemn occasion. It consisted of a few
prayers; Psalms xc. and cxxx.; the favourite hymns
of the late Queen: ‘Hark, hark my soul!’ ‘Lead,
kindly light,’ and an anthem, ‘All ye who weep,’
with Gounod’s music. No address was given, but
the two final prayers—one in memory of the late
Queen, the other invoking the Almighty’s blessing
on the new King—were specially written for the
occasion, and went home to the hearts of all present.
The Rev. Dr. Noyes conducted the service, assisted
by several other clergymen resident in Paris, and
the choir, consisting of about fifty voices, was heard
to great advantage.</p>

<p>“The church was sumptuously decorated in black
drapery and silver, but, possibly, the effect would
have been more impressive if the large monograms
V.I.R., in bright yellow, and the Royal Arms in
colours, had not figured so prominently.</p>

<p>“Lady Monson was early in attendance, and Sir
Michael Herbert, assisted by Mr. Austin Lee, Commercial
Attaché, and Mr. Colville Barclay received
the numerous and influential congregation.</p>

<p>“Mme. Loubet, accompanied by Mmes. Dubois
and Combarieu, was amongst the early arrivals,
Colonel Nicholas in attendance. The President was
represented by M. Combarieu.</p>

<p>“Mme. Loubet, upon her arrival, was conducted
to a seat near the choir, by the side of Lady Monson.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“One side of the church was reserved to the
Diplomatic corps, every member of which was present,
save, of course, the Papal Nuncio, and the
Russian Ambassador, who was unwell, and was represented
by his First Secretary. On the other, all the
members of the present Cabinet, who without exception
were present in person, including M.
Waldeck-Rousseau, President of the Council, MM.
Dupuy, Delcassé, Pierre Baudin, General André,
etc., also M. Paul Deschanel, President of the
Chamber of Deputies; M. Fallières, President of the
Senate; the Military Governor of Paris, the Prefect
of the Seine, and a great number of Deputies, MM.
Hanotaux, Le Myre de Viliers, R. Bompard, etc.</p>

<p>“The lower gallery at the back of the church was
reserved for representatives of Royalty: Prince
Roland Bonaparte, Princesse Mathilde, Princesse
Marie of Mecklenburg, and the Baron Machiba,
representing the Countess d’Eu.</p>

<p>“Amongst other notabilities present were:
Baronne Faverot de Kebrech (Née Seymour), Marquis
de Lau, Marquise de Peralt, Comte de Vettre,
Comte de Ganay, Baron Edouard de Rothschild,
Baronne Decases Stackelberg, Comte and Comtesse
Jean de Castellane, Vicomte Léon de Janze, Mr.
John K. Gowdy (American Consul), MM. Crozier
(Chef du Protocol) and Mollard, Marquis
d’Harcourt, MM. Picard and F. Arago, Comte
Greffulhe, Comte de Clermont-Tonnerre, and M. and
Mme. Benjamin Constant.</p>

<p>“The English Colony was represented by: Sir
Edward and Lady Sassoon, Colonel Mapleson, Mr.
Henry Blount, Mr. (now Sir) T. Barclay (President
of the Chamber of Commerce), Mr. T. Hounsfield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
(Vice-President), Messrs. Inglis (Consul,) J. (now
Sir John) Pilter, W. C. Robertson, P. Lammin and
Mrs. Lammin, Messrs. Spearman, Ablett, and C. E.
Lord, Captain Churchward, and Messrs. Brigstocke
and A. Coleman.</p>

<p>“At the close the organ pealed forth the well-known
Dead March in ‘Saul,’ the effect of which
was marred by the departing congregation, who,
after the French fashion, shook hands with Sir
Michael Herbert and the other attachés to the Embassy,
who stood in a row near the porch.</p>

<p>“The afternoon service was of an equally simple
character, in fact it was like the one held in the
morning. But instead of officials clad in their
showy uniforms, it was composed of the English
and American Colonies—those who felt that they
had lost one who was very dear to them. The service
seemed far more solemn than that of the morning,
and handkerchiefs and tears were by no means
scarce. The Rev. Dr. Noyes again conducted the
service, and as the deep-toned sounds of the organ
rolled out the Dead March, the faces of many of
those present showed that, as the laureate has so
beautifully expressed it, ‘She is dead; and the World
is widowed.’”</p>

<p>The same evening I received the following letter
from the Hon. Michael Herbert (now, alas, no
more):—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“British Embassy,<br />
“Saturday Evening.</p>

<p class="noindent">“Dear Dr. Noyes,—</p>

<p>“Before the end of this memorable day I must
write you a line to express my appreciation and that
of the Embassy of the manner in which the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
services in the Rue d’Aguesseau Church were conducted
to-day. The music was excellent, and both
services seemed to me worthy of this sad and solemn
occasion.</p>

<p>“I fear many people were unable to find places
at the afternoon services, but I trust they will be
able to secure room to-morrow.</p>

<p class="center">“Yours very sincerely,</p>

<p class="right">“M. H. HERBERT.”</p>

</div>

<p>The late Hon. M. Herbert was first Secretary
of the Embassy, highly respected, and one who took
a keen interest in all that concerned the British
Colony. The services were continued on the following
day. Sir Edmund Monson, our Ambassador in
Paris, was not present at the services, owing to the
fact that he had been summoned to London to attend
the funeral service. Services were also held in the
Roman Catholic Church for English members of
that Communion, in the Russian Church, and in
several other places of worship. Indeed, an atmosphere
of sadness seemed to rest over the whole city.
All the English houses of business were closed,
many exhibiting draped flags. Groups of people
would stand under these flags conversing in an
undertone, and many were the kind remarks by the
passing crowds. I heard one say, “She was a good
mother to all her people.” I may mention that I
asked the Rev. P. Beaton and Rev. J. Milne, Presbyterian
clergy in Paris, to take part in the official
service, and each read a lesson.</p>

<p>In 1902, the English Colony in Paris were
looking forward with the greatest interest to the
all-important event fixed for the 26th of June, the
Coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
had been decided that a service should be held and
a fête given to all the British working classes and
poor resident in Paris, and extensive preparations
were made. Then on June 24th came the startling
news that the King was ill, and the Coronation
ceremony had been postponed. The first intimation
we had was a telegram which was posted at the
Bourse. The excitement was intense, and the
sorrow and anxiety in the British Colony seemed intensified
from the fact that we were residents abroad
and far from the centre of interest—the Palace
where the King lay. As soon as I heard of the
telegram I called at the Embassy, and found that
the news was only too true, and that all had been
postponed. As is well known, instead of the
Coronation Service in Westminster Abbey, an
Intercession Service was held in St. Paul’s Cathedral.
We decided that a corresponding service should be
held in Paris, and I shall not soon forget the solemnity
of that hour. The church was well filled, all
the staff of the British Embassy being present. We
all sang the National Anthem kneeling, and never,
I believe, was prayer more earnest that God would
spare our beloved King. During those anxious days
every item of news was eagerly sought, and great was
the relief when we heard that the operation by Sir
Frederick Treves had been successful, and that our
prayers had been answered in the safety and then
recovery of His Majesty. There was at that time
no “Entente Cordiale,” but the sympathy and
anxiety of the French people was very manifest.
News was published hour by hour, and in the evenings,
on the Boulevards, the latest bulletins were
given in immense letters, shown by electric light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
from the office of the “Echo de Paris.” The month
of August—when happily the Coronation could take
place—is the holiday month in Paris, and the city
is supposed to be empty. As a matter of fact almost
the whole of the British Colony is then away. In
view of this it was decided to postpone the fêtes
until the close of this memorable year. We held,
however, special services in the church, when I took
occasion to comment upon the Coronation Service,
and to explain parts of this solemn religious ceremony.
The fêtes came off in December, and were
a great success.</p>

<p>In 1903 we had a visit of Members of the British
Parliament to Paris. As they were staying over a
Sunday, and many ladies—wives and daughters of
Members—were in the party, I wrote to the Secretary
proposing that a special service should be held.
Sir E. Monson very kindly fell in with the suggestion,
and arranged for the service at three p.m.,
with a reception at the Embassy, a few yards away,
to follow the service. About three hundred persons
were present. I preached from the text: “Render
therefore unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar’s,
and unto God the things which are God’s.” I never
had a more attentive congregation. Many of the
Members at the subsequent reception were kind
enough to express to me their appreciation of the
service.</p>

<p>Later we had an official visit from the London
County Council, which left very pleasant memories;
and in 1906 the City Fathers came over, headed
by Sir Walter Vaughan-Morgan, for whom also I
held a special service. I have given some details
of this visit in another chapter.</p>

PECULIAR CALLS UPON A CONTINENTAL CHAPLAIN.</span></h2>

<p>More frequently than at home, the calls upon
a chaplain abroad are various and sometimes
peculiar. This applies especially to Paris, which,
being comparatively near home and easy of access, is
largely patronized by holiday makers, and has besides
a considerable resident British Colony. There are
about 12,000 English (according to the last census)
resident or travelling. I was sixteen-and-a-half years
in Paris, during which period my experiences have
been somewhat varied. It is proposed in this article
to give some extracts from letters received at different
times and requests made, which illustrate the fact
that a chaplain abroad is often expected to know
some things besides those connected with his calling.</p>

</div>

<p>A lady writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am an invalid now in F⸺, and desire to
come to Paris, and would be obliged if you would
take rooms for me. Would you please see that
the mattress in my bedroom is made of hair, and
not wool, as I cannot sleep on the latter.”</p>

</div>

<p>My wife kindly arranged for this good lady.</p>

<p>Another lady writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Some time since I purchased some Panama
Bonds, and am receiving no dividend. Would you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
please make enquiries about them and let me know
if they are of any value, and if I can sell them.”</p>

</div>

<p>I obtained and sent her the information she required.</p>

<p>A gentleman writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A relative of mine (giving the name) died in
Paris about the year 18—, and was I think buried
in Père-la-Chaise. Could you find out if this were
so, and whereabouts the grave is.”</p>

</div>

<p>Those who know Père-la-Chaise and other cemeteries
of Paris will realize what a difficult task was
here given to the chaplain. The grave, however,
was found.</p>

<p>A lady came to the Vestry one morning and asked
to see me. She told me she was leaving Paris, and
had a pet monkey which she did not wish to take with
her, and would I find it a home. I was glad to be
able to arrange this for her.</p>

<p>A clergyman writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I hope to bring a party of twelve to fifteen
artisans over to Paris.… We leave England
on the evening of ⸺, and arrive in Paris on
Saturday. I do not know Paris, and venture to
write to you to ask if you will be so good as to
secure rooms for us, as cheaply as you can, and if
you will just tell us where to go.” This request
was granted.</p>

</div>

<p>On passing to the pulpit one Sunday a paper was
handed to me by one of the congregation. It was to
ask me to say from the pulpit that the applicant
desired a wife about 25 to 30 years of age—domesticated,
etc. He added that he was prepared to take
the one I recommended, and that he had means to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
support her. I need hardly say the notice was not
given.</p>

<p>A lady writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Kindly excuse my asking your help in a little
matter. Can you kindly give me the names and
addresses of anyone who would act as my agent
and try to sell a little ‘scissors sharpener,’ which I
have lately brought out. I have patented it in
France, etc., etc.” I was sorry not to be able to
find anyone who would undertake the commission.</p>

</div>

<p>A Colonial clergyman wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I make a great hobby of optics and lenses. I
have a large collection of optical instruments, etc.,
of French make. Now I find there is a most unreasonable
prejudice against French glasses. I believe
this prejudice could be removed if I could get
a few catalogues of reliable French firms. Could
you get me some and send them out, etc.” I was
glad to comply with this request.</p>

</div>

<p>There were various “scares” of a revolution during
my sojourn in Paris, and one was frequently called
upon to calm the fears of the timid. The following
extract is an illustration.</p>

<p>A well-known gentleman wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A lady with whom we were dining last night
is much alarmed, and has frightened my wife about
an impending revolution arranged for May 1st in
Paris. She said she had heard that a Royalist
Prince was hidden in Paris prepared to seize the
reins of Government backed by the aristocracy, and
that arms, bombs, and munitions are available.
She also said that she had it on good authority that
at our Embassy the prospects of a row were considered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
serious. She asked me to take her and my
wife out of Paris till the date should be passed.…
I should like to know what is your opinion, and also
whether you propose doing anything for your own
family.” I gave him my opinion, and nothing
happened, except that Paris was quieter than usual.</p>

</div>

<p>The following request was more difficult. A lady
writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Having seen in the London papers that Paris
has a working scheme for the improved feeding of
babies, I am anxious to learn more about it. As
you so kindly offer to help visitors in various ways,
I thought perhaps I might venture to ask you for
the necessary information, etc., etc.”</p>

</div>

<p>The request evidently referred to the system of
“couveuses” by which prematurely born children
were saved, a system which has proved generally successful.</p>

<p>I referred her to the public exhibitions of these
“incubators,” which were being held in the Boulevards
at that time.</p>

<p>Another request was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I am in a difficulty. Can you tell me where
there are any Poultry Farms in France. Also
could you find out for me if the Editor of ⸺ got
six francs 25 c. which I sent him through the
postman.… Can you tell me would it be
possible for me to get a post in connection with
poultry farming in France, or in a gentleman’s
family.… I am domesticated, and can make
good jams, marmalade, and cakes. What papers
(French) do you advise me to advertise in. I know
nothing of French customs and hardly anything of
the language.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>These are extracts from a long and rather rambling
letter, which I was unable to answer to the writer’s
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The following letter relates to the subject of marriage,
and is one of many I received on the same
question:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Dear Sir,—I have been asked by a French
lady … whether an Earl or Duke, or any
titled man may legally marry under the simple
family name. For instance, if a Duke of Z⸺,
wishing to conceal his identity, could marry as Mr.
X⸺, or whatever his family name might be.
Also could he elope with a young lady and marry
her in some out of the way village at once, or must
they both reside there for a certain length of time,
and have the Banns called three times. This is a
lot of rubbish to bother you with, but if you will
be good enough to give me this information it would
certainly oblige my friend.”</p>

</div>

<p>To this I replied giving both the French and English
regulations as to marriage, and I heard no more
of the case. I am sorry to say that during my chaplaincy
there were several sad cases of desertion after
mixed marriages (French and English); but these
will be more easily dealt with under “The difficulties
of English people abroad.”</p>

<p>The calls of anxious parents to meet girls coming
abroad to situations, and to look after them, and
requests to find French families where young men
and maidens could be placed for education in the
language, and enquiries as to schools, pensions, and
hotels, were a pleasant though constant part of every
day’s work. A list of reliable abodes was kept, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
one had the satisfaction of being able to be of real
service in this way to hundreds of one’s fellow countrymen,
who without good advice too often get into
difficulties.</p>

<p>One rather frequent call upon the services of the
chaplain, in the earlier part of my work in Paris, is
happily no longer necessary. We frequently got
urgent letters and telegrams from India to look after
people who had been bitten by snakes, dogs, a jackal,
etc., and were hastening to France to put themselves
under the Pasteur treatment; and with some the experiences
were very painful, as they arrived too late
for the cure to be successful.</p>

<p>Now happily our Government has provided a
similar institution in India, so that those who need
it can be immediately attended to. This splendid
institution in Paris is, however, well worth the attention
of visitors.</p>

<p>There were occasionally English people in Paris
suffering from mental disease—not sufficiently insane
to be placed under control, but yet ill enough to cause
considerable trouble.</p>

<p>Upon one occasion a man came to me and gave
me a sealed packet, telling me it contained a most
important document, and it was not to be opened
unless I heard of his death.</p>

<p>His manner made me think it might be of real
importance, and he did not strike me as insane.
Some years after I heard of his death, and opened the
packet, and found it contained only torn pieces of
paper with no writing upon them.</p>

<p>One poor lady who lived in Paris during the whole
of my stay there, frequently wrote me letters—literally
yards long—some of them must have taken her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
many hours to write. Yet on many points she was
sane enough, and was engaged for years in teaching
English to the French, both privately and in classes.</p>

<p>I had not been long in Paris before I was asked
through the secretary of the “Société de Steeplechase”
to join a syndicate for the purpose of adjudicating
upon any question that might arise connected
with the riders. I was supposed to represent the
English jockeys, being the only Englishman on the
board. I accepted the position, as it was represented
that I might often be of some service to my fellow
countrymen, although I knew nothing of the race-course.
I regularly received, up to the date of my
departure from Paris, tickets for the reserved enclosure.
Sometimes friends visiting me appeared
shocked at seeing these in my study, until I explained
the reason. A copy of the card, which may be
interesting, appears on the next page.</p>

<p>The syndicate met very rarely, and I never had
any serious case upon which to pass judgment.</p>

<p>A peculiar call was made upon me one day. I
was passing the Arc de Triomphe when a gusty wind
removed several hats. In front of me was a nursemaid
wheeling a perambulator. The wind took her
hat, and all her hair, which fell at my feet. It was
an embarrassing moment, but I fulfilled my duty, and
handed it all to the blushing maiden.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="smaller">EDUCATION IN FRANCE.</span></h2>

<p>I was often asked by anxious parents as to the
facilities for education in France, indeed it was part
of one’s daily work answering enquiries on the subject.
It may not be out of place to give here the
result of my experience. For English boys there are
very few schools carried on as our public schools are
in England. For parents living abroad, the best plan
is to send their young boys to French “cours” or
classes, of which there are many, where they will
readily pick up the language, and then to send them
over to England for further education. The instruction
given in French schools is not of the character
or sufficient for those who intend to enter professional
life in England. When it is not convenient to send
boys to England, I would strongly advise parents to
see the school carried on by my friend, Mr. E. P.
Denny, M.A. (Oxon.), at 55 Boulevard Suchet. He
has been very successful, and parents may safely
entrust their sons to his care. For older boys and
young men entering the army or navy it is better to
select one of the many French families where young
men are received to learn the language. The resident
chaplain can always supply a list of thoroughly
reliable homes. For mercantile life some of the
Lycées are very good. I may especially mention the
Lycée Lakanal, at Bourg la Reine, a short distance
by rail or tram from Paris, where many English boys
have been received, and where every care is taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
as to moral training. I was appointed by the French
Government as Religious Instructor for the English
boys there, and occupied the position for some years,
so that I had every opportunity of knowing the merits
of the school.</p>

<p>The advantages for English girls in Paris are very
great. There are a number of excellent schools, as
well managed as any of our schools at home. It is
not usual to receive very young girls or day boarders
in the best schools. For the most part they are
finishing schools, and the girls do not usually stay
more than one year. I need hardly say anything to
commend the old-established school founded by
Madame Yeatman in the Boulevard Victor Hugo,
Neuilly. Her name is well known in England and
America, and other parts of the world. Some eight
to nine hundred young ladies passed through this
school during my sojourn in Paris, and the classes I
held there will always be a pleasant memory.
Madame Yeatman is now enjoying a well-earned rest,
although she continues to take the kindliest interest
in the school, and her charming house with access
to it enables her to pay frequent visits. Madame
Yeatman displayed her knowledge of character in the
choice of Miss Easton to carry on the work, a lady
eminently suited to the position, who has already
attained to a well-merited success. An interesting
gathering of old pupils is held every year at the Grand
Hotel in London, known as the “Yeatmanite tea.”</p>

<p>Another school which I can speak of in equally
commendatory words is that carried on at “The
Maronneries,” Auteuil, by Mlles. Hogg and Guyomard.
This is quite an up-to-date establishment, and
has largely increased of late years. Two houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
standing in extensive gardens, and a large field for
recreation, make one feel quite in the country.
Nothing can exceed the kindness and care of the
principals—the teaching is excellent, and many of
the pupils have gained high distinction in French
examinations. These two schools occupy the galleries
in the Embassy Church every Sunday morning, forming
an important part of the congregation. I always
felt the responsibility of speaking to so many young
people, who would so soon occupy important positions
in English life.</p>

<p>Besides these two large schools there are several
excellent smaller ones where equal advantages may
be obtained. Some of them take a certain number of
French girls, who take their lessons with the English—an
arrangement for and against which something
may be said. The more important of these, and all
of which I knew well, and can speak of in the highest
terms, are Mlle. Lacarrère, Rue St. James, Neuilly;
Mlle. Bourré, Auteuil; Madame d’Almaine, Passy;
Madame Morel de Fos, Bolougne-sur-Seine; Mlles.
Expulson and Metherell, Auteuil. The Marquise de
San Carlos has a successful school at Bornel, about
two hours from Paris, which is a delightful country
home for girls, for whom it may be well to add a
country life to the advantages of education. There
are other schools, French and partly French and
English, which I do not mention, not because of any
reason against them, but only that I was not brought
into contact with them in the way that I was with the
above.</p>

<p>Sometimes parents have written to me asking if
it was safe to send English girls to France at all,
and many have sent their daughters in fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and trembling. My answer was that if parents
would only be careful in the choice of a school, and
consult those on the spot, who had no object to serve
but to give the best advice they could to enquirers,
no harm would result. Schools in Paris cannot be
carried on cheaply—the necessaries of life are all taxed,
and consequently living is dearer than in the country in
England. Many mistakes have been made from
choosing a school where the fees were a few pounds
less than others. Those who cannot afford a good
school had better keep their daughters at home.
Convents have been a temptation to some owing to
cheapness, and I would warn parents who are anxious
(as all should be) about the religious education of their
children that they should avoid these establishments
for their daughters. The food is often insufficient for
English girls, who find it hard to work on the
“petit déjeûner” up to midday, and I have known
many become anæmic from this cause. But this is
not the only difficulty. While the promise is frequently
made that there shall be no interference with
the religious belief of the pupil, it is rarely kept.
Parents should remember that it is after all the
business of a convent to propagate the religion of the
Church of Rome, and if parents, for the sake of
cheapness, allow their children to go, they must not
be surprised at the consequences. I had several most
painful cases while in Paris where the parent was
inclined to blame the chaplain for what had happened—whereas
his advice had not been asked in the first
instance. I do not as a rule recommend French
families for girls. There are some most excellent
homes (French pastors and others) where every care
is taken. But I have known others where there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
culpable laxity. English girls cannot go out alone in
Paris as they do in England, it would not be safe,
and in some families it is not easy to find a chaperon,
and mischief follows. In seeking a family for an
English girl, it is well to ask if there are any daughters
about the age of the pupil, as if so the above difficulty
is lessened.</p>

<p>One further point about learning French. It is
important for both sexes that they should (if
beginners) learn colloquial French from one who
speaks some English—at least sufficient to explain the
meaning of words. I have known some ludicrous
mistakes arise from this cause.</p>

<p>On the whole I recommend Paris rather than the
country parts of France for the education of young
people; it is the centre for music and art in all its
branches, and the best professors congregate there.
Moreover, in case of illness or difficulty of any kind,
it is better not to be too far from home, or an English
doctor, and may I say, an English clergyman.</p>

<p>The children of the working classes in Paris are
well provided for in the British schools, where they
receive a good sound elementary education, both in
French and English. The children trained in these
schools do remarkably well, as they are taught shorthand
and typewriting in both languages, and are thus
able to take positions in French commercial houses,
and earn good salaries. There are often more applications
for boys than can be met. The schools are
managed by a committee of which Sir Henry Austin
Lee, C.B., is the chairman, who takes the warmest
interest in their welfare. A small fee is collected
from those able to pay, and the very poor are paid for
by the British Charitable Fund.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="smaller">DIFFICULTIES OF ENGLISH PEOPLE ABROAD.</span></h2>

<p>It was part of my duty during a chaplaincy of
sixteen years in Paris to help our fellow country
people, who from one cause or another got into
difficulty.</p>

<p>Sometimes it was their own fault, and similar
conduct would have brought a like result at home.
But often these difficulties arose from ignorance of
the language, and from an extraordinary disregard
of French law. Too often the Englishman not only
expects his own language to be spoken, but also the
laws of his own country to prevail in a foreign land.</p>

<p>Not long after I commenced work in Paris I
received the following telegram, addressed to</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Le Pasteur Eglise Protestante.—Please come
as soon as possible to the Depot—Préfecture de
Police—to a member of your congregation who
seeks your help at once.”</p>

</div>

<p>I lost no time in going down, and found that the
writer—an English governess—had, in a moment of
temptation, stolen a pair of gloves at the Magasin du
Louvre. I believe it was a first offence. I did all I
could to console her, but was unable to get her off,
and she had to undergo a term of six days’ imprisonment.
I regret to say that this instance of “Kleptomania”
was by no means singular. The system at
the larger shops in Paris lends itself to pilfering by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
the dishonest, as the goods are displayed in such a
way that it seems easy to steal. The manager of the
Louvre shop told me that they had on an average
twelve arrests a day. It is not generally known that
a large number of detectives are always employed,
who are continually on the watch. There was one
sad case of a lady who had come to Paris to place her
daughter in a school, and who had ample means, and
yet took some gloves from the same establishment.
With considerable difficulty she was released upon the
payment of 600 francs (£24), a good price for a pair
of gloves. One other case in which I was successful
in obtaining the release of a woman who was, I
believe, innocent, but in a moment of thoughtlessness,
put over her arm a covering for a child’s bed. I had
known her for a long time; she was the mother of a
large family, all well brought up. She assured me
she had intended to pay for it, but no attendant being
near she went to another part of the shop with the
article in question, when she was arrested, and invited
to appear in court to answer to the charge. I wrote
to the Judge and told him what I knew about her,
and he kindly gave her the benefit of the doubt. Her
husband (a waiter) was away in Germany, and had
she been imprisoned it would have been the ruin of
her family.</p>

<p>By the kindness of the late Earl of Lytton, I
obtained a pass enabling me to visit any of the
prisons in Paris, where English people might be
confined. Many of the cases were very sad, and
especially where the prisoners could not speak French,
as this added to the misery of their lot. I recall one
case, which interested me much. It was that of a
young man who had come to visit Paris, and like so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
many others, had been led where he soon got into
difficulty.</p>

<p>He came with a considerable sum of money and
went one evening to the “Moulin Rouge”—which
at that time was of questionable repute. (It is said
to be under better management now.)</p>

<p>He was relieved of his purse, which contained a
1,000 franc note, beside some coins. He had left
only a 100 franc note in his hotel, and went the
next morning to the bank to get it changed—very
much irritated, as he said, with the French for having
stolen his money! At the bank he saw a French
gentleman counting some notes, and he snatched a
number of them and ran away. He was soon
arrested and was sent to prison for some years. He
assured me it was his first offence, and that he had no
intention of stealing when he went to the bank.</p>

<p>On another occasion I unwittingly broke the
prison rules. An aged Englishman had been imprisoned
for picking pockets on the race course. He
said his wife did not know what had happened, and
begged me to give him something to buy paper and
stamps. I gave him a franc, but as I was leaving the
prison an official came up and handed me the franc,
telling me I had broken the rule. They had been
watching me while I was locked in the cell, and made
the poor man give up the money.</p>

<p>Ignorance of the language was frequently the
cause of difficulty. One morning a nurse came to the
vestry in the Rue d’Aguesseau, and when I enquired
her business, said, “Why, I am lost, and have been
walking the streets all night.” She then told me
she arrived at the Gare St. Lazare the previous evening,
and was driven by the cabman to an address<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
near, which she had now forgotten. She went out to
post a letter, and must have taken a wrong turning,
and so was soon lost. She walked about all night,
and had only just found an English-speaking person,
who had directed her to the Church. I gathered from
her description where the Home was, and sent her up
with my Vestry Clerk.</p>

<p>On another occasion a girl was brought to me in
great distress. She told me she had started from
England on the previous day to visit a French friend
of her mother’s. She had the address written on a
piece of paper, which she was instructed to give to the
cabman, as she did not speak French.</p>

<p>She travelled by the night boat to Calais. When
she arrived at the Gare du Nord, she could not find
the paper, and, staying to look among her parcels,
the English travellers all left. She got out of the
train and did not know what to do; she spoke to a
porter who did not understand her, and eventually
left the station. This was about 7 a.m. She walked
about the streets until late in the afternoon, when
she was heard near the Madeleine trying to explain
to a policeman. The Englishman who heard her
brought her to me, and I sent her back the next day
to England, as I failed to discover her friend’s name
in any directory.</p>

<p>On another occasion I received a telegram from a
lady in Ireland asking me to meet her daughter that
evening at the Gare St. Lazare, who was going to a
situation as governess, which she had obtained
through an advertisement. I met the girl, and took
her to the address she gave. It was a small wine
shop, and altogether unsuited to her, and would, I
fear, have been a very dangerous position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>I persuaded her to go to the excellent G.F.S.
Lodge, where she was most kindly received, and
eventually a good position was found for her.</p>

<p>The above are illustrations of many like cases
which were brought before me.</p>

<p>More serious cases are illustrated by the following
telegram:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Please remove Miss X⸺ from 14 rue ⸺
at once; very urgent, letter follows.”⸺</p>

</div>

<p>These requests often involved considerable time
and trouble, and the laying aside for the time of all
other work.</p>

<p>One morning I received a request from the
manager of one of the leading hotels to call as soon as
possible. I went down and was told that an English
girl had been left there by a “gentleman,” and was
in great distress.</p>

<p>I found that she had left her home two or three
days previously on the promise of marriage, and was
now left without means, and was afraid to communicate
with her parents.</p>

<p>I placed her in a room in a smaller hotel, and in
the meantime wrote to the father. However, before
he received my letter he had started for Paris, having
heard his daughter was there, and came to see me in
great anxiety about his child. His relief and
astonishment were remarkable when I told him I
knew the whereabouts of his daughter. A reconciliation
was effected, and the girl was taken home.</p>

<p>One of the most remarkable illustrations of the
difficulties English people sometimes get into abroad
is the following:</p>

<p>Early one morning (6 a.m.) I was sent for to visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
two young ladies in a small hotel, who were said to
have become insane.</p>

<p>I went down and found one of the sisters on the
ground floor holding the door leading to the staircase,
and not allowing anyone to pass. She would answer
no question, nor permit me to pass to see her sister.
With some difficulty I obtained access to the room
where the sister was, by another way, but found her
in a like state, and unwilling to answer any question,
or to give the address of any relative. The difficulty
was that the proprietor of the hotel wished to have
them removed at once to an asylum, which I felt
would only aggravate the malady from which they
suffered. I called in an English doctor (since passed
away) who most kindly helped, and forbade the proprietor
to have them removed. By searching
amongst the papers in their room I discovered an
address in London, and telegraphed for their relatives
to come at once. My wife and I had a trying experience
all that night—we sat up with the girls, one
of whom had to be fastened to the bed, having become
violent. She was shouting all night, and gave a
great deal of trouble.</p>

<p>The relatives arrived the next morning, and the
necessary steps were taken for their removal. It
turned out that these young ladies had been dabbling
in hypnotism, and had spent the greater part of
the day previous to their illness with some “professor.”
One died and the other only recovered after
a long illness.</p>

<p class="caption">BRITISH CONSUL-GENERAL.</p>
</div>

<p>We frequently had to help English artists connected
with circuses, shows, etc., who got stranded in
France. One morning a smart-looking person called
at the house and told me she had a number of performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
dogs held at the Gare de Lyon because of
some payment demanded, which she could not
meet. If she could not get the dogs she
would be ruined. By the kind help of the
British Charitable Fund I was able to get the
dogs set free. On another occasion, when I went
down to service, I found in the Church some fifty
ballet girls waiting to see me. They had been
brought over to play in an exhibition in Paris, but
the proprietor having failed, the light was cut off
and the place closed. They had no means to get back
to England. By the kindness of the British Consul,
and again by the help of the British Charitable Fund,
these girls were all sent back, and very grateful they
were. Not knowing the language they were indeed
“strangers in a strange land.” Whenever companies
of English girls came over to perform in
theatre or music hall, I tried to get opportunities to
address them; but it was not an easy part of one’s
duty.</p>

<p>Difficulties owing to mixed marriages frequently
arose. It cannot be too often explained that there
is no difficulty in two English people being married
abroad, providing there is no impediment such as
would prevent the marriage at home. Civil marriage
at the British Consulate should first take place, and
the religious ceremony can follow. But in the case
of mixed marriages it is absolutely necessary that the
contracting parties should satisfy French law, and
first be civilly married at the Mairie. A marriage
(French and English) in England is not valid in
France unless the French Consul in England has first
performed the civil rite. Much distress has been
caused by not obeying the law. I will give but one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
instance, though I might give many. It is an important
one, as questions were asked in the House of
Commons about it, and a statement as to the law
sent broadcast to the Clergy of England. The case
is this:</p>

<p>Madame X⸺, an English woman, came to live
in Paris. She was a widow with children. She
obtained, through my instrumentality, a position as
secretary. After a time her employer proposed marriage.
He told her, however, that his parents would
not give their consent (which in France is a bar to
marriage), and proposed that they should go to
England, and be married in Church. They went, and
after complying with the law as to residence, were
married in London. When they returned to Paris
the husband refused to let his wife live in his house,
but told her to remain in her own flat. When she
pressed him on the subject his only reply was, “I
suppose you know that the English marriage is not
valid in France.”</p>

<p>She came to see me broken-hearted. I did all I
could for her, but it was useless. The husband only
laughed at me. The case was put into the hand of
a solicitor, and brought before the French courts, but
the judgment was given against the wife. The Judge
told her she ought to have been more careful to ascertain
the law. Thus she is legally married in England,
but not in France, while her husband is free to marry
whom he may choose without hindrance.</p>

<p>If, however, he came to England, he would be
legally married to the woman he now repudiates. I
have stated this case in full as it may be a warning
to others, though much more care is now taken than
was formerly the case. I laid the whole case before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
the late Bishop of London (Dr. Creighton) who
wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The case you bring before me is a very sad
one, but I do not see what can be done either to
obtain redress or to prevent such cases occurring in
the future. Marriage is a contract regulated by
law; if anyone marries a foreigner they ought to
take legal advice about the necessary steps to
legalize their marriage. I do not see who is to
protect them except themselves. Our Government
cannot ask the French Government to recognize
as binding in France all marriages solemnized in
England. This would open a door to evasion of the
French law. The difficulty in these cases arises
from the belief that marriage is a purely ecclesiastical
matter, and that ecclesiastical procedure is
universally recognized. Really marriage is a civil
contract which in England the clergy are authorised
to perform by the State. To this in their ecclesiastical
capacity they add a religious service. People
have mixed these two together in their own minds
with disastrous results.”</p>

</div>

<p>The extraordinary tangles into which English
people sometimes get from ignorance—wilful or otherwise—of
the marriage law, is illustrated by the following
remarkable case which came under my notice.
A French working man living in London married an
English woman in his Parish Church. He could not
legalise the marriage at the French Consulate because
he had not the consent of his parents. This consent
is generally necessary for any legal marriage of French
people, whatever their age may be. One can easily
see the reason for this requirement when the law of
inheritance is taken into consideration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>No French father can “cut his son off with a
shilling,” as in England. They must leave their
money to their children, and the younger benefit
equally with the elder. This is the reason the realization
of property must take place on the death of
anyone. It is, however, generally arranged in the
family, and does not necessarily come before the
public. The couple of our story did not possess any
property, being working people. The husband had
lived in England from childhood, and consequently
had not done his military service. When the question
arose as to the legality of his marriage, he promised
he would not return to France. While living in
England the marriage was, of course, perfectly in
order, but the day came when the husband wished to
go back to his own country, and he went to Paris with
his wife and two children. Needless to say, the man
was at once arrested for his military service. It is
extraordinary to English minds to see how quickly
the arrival of any man in France who is liable for
military service is noted by the Government officials,
and he receives a summons to join his regiment at
once.</p>

<p>While serving three years (or two as it is now) in
the army, a soldier is not allowed to marry, and so
X’s wife was without a legal husband, and any means
of subsistence. She took her two children and went
to live with her father and mother-in-law, who became
very fond of her and the grandchildren. We helped
her for a time with money and work, and I expect she
provided her English made husband with the pocket
money for tobacco, etc., so much needed by the
French soldier. Towards the end of the three years,
preparations were made to legalize the marriage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
France, the parents giving their consent willingly.
When, however, the time came, and it only remained
to give notice at the Mairie of the intended marriage,
X refused to re-marry his wife, and so legalize her
claim to the title in France. It was found that he had
taken up with another woman better looking than his
wife, who had no claim to beauty, and whose hard
work to support the children during this time had
rendered less attractive. X’s father and mother were
furious with him and offered to adopt the children.
Matters were in this condition, when another misfortune
fell upon this poor woman. She took
smallpox. The hospital for this terrible disease is
one of the worst managed in Paris, and the hardships
of the unfortunate patients are often very
great. When the poor soul came out she returned
to the only home she had—the tiny flat of her father-in-law—and
was equal to very little work. The
grandparents had cared for the children, but they were
also poor, and found it difficult to make ends meet.
We were almost in despair as to how to help her, as it
was a large order to undertake the whole family. The
solution of the whole matter would hardly be imagined
by one brought up in England. Mrs. X. one day
came to me at the vestry in the Rue d’Aguesseau, and
said she was going to marry a Frenchman, who was
not only willing to support her and the children, but
would adopt and legalize them as his own. This can
be done in France, and the real father has then no
claim to them whatever. I spoke to her very seriously,
and told her that her lawful husband being
alive, she would be committing bigamy, and that I
could have nothing whatever to do with such an
arrangement. I pointed out to her that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
be the legal wife of one man in England and another
in France; that in England she would be the lawful
wife of the first man, while English law would not
only refuse to recognise this second so-called marriage,
but could prosecute her for bigamy.</p>

<p>Nothing I could say had any effect upon her, the
only thing she would say was “I will never go back
to England.”</p>

<p>She has now gone through the French “marriage”
at the Mairie, and is happy. It solved our difficulty as
to the support of herself and children, but the complication
in which she has involved herself and the two
children is one of the most extraordinary I met with.</p>

<p>Occasionally there were very sad circumstances
attending the death of lonely English people in Paris.
At the close of the Boer war, an English soldier who
had fought in South Africa died in the Beaujon
Hospital. We could not discover how he had
wandered to Paris, or get from him any information
as to relatives.</p>

<p>The only persons present at the grave were myself
and the vestry clerk. Just as the body was being
lowered into the grave the clerk placed upon the
coffin a small British flag.</p>

<p>And here I should like to bear testimony to the
devoted work of Mr. Wicker. His father was Vestry
Clerk before him for many years—through nearly the
whole of the long ministry of Dr. Forbes. When he
died I appointed his son. Brought up in Paris and
speaking both languages, and thoroughly in earnest
in his work, his services are invaluable to the
Chaplain.</p>

<p>Another sad case was that of a girl named X⸺,
who had run away from home four years before her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
death with the son of a ship builder, who deserted
her two days before her end. The parents had lost
sight of her, and were too late to see her alive. The
funeral was most distressing. The number of English
people “under a cloud” who bury themselves in
Paris is not small, and the chaplain has frequently
very sad cases with which to deal.</p>

<p>Of late years, since the French have taken so
kindly to “afternoon teas,” English people have been
tempted to open tea shops, without having carefully
considered the difficulty and expense of carrying on a
business in a foreign land. Several came to grief
during my sojourn in Paris.</p>

<p>One of the saddest cases, which may prove a
warning to others who have had similar ideas, is the
following:</p>

<p>In the year ⸺ two ladies, daughters of an
English clergyman, came to Paris and opened a tea
shop. For a time they did fairly well, and their
business fell off chiefly owing to a French shop being
opened in the neighbourhood. Things got so bad that
they suddenly closed the shop and left for England.</p>

<p>On the way, under mental excitement, one of the
sisters jumped from the train and was seriously
injured. As a report was spread that only one of the
sisters had left, I went down with the officials and
forced the establishment, expecting to find the other
sister dead. The report, however, proved to be
false, for both had left. It was a sad ending to a
foolish venture.</p>

<p>One Sunday evening as I was returning from
Church, I was overheard speaking English, and two
young men stopped me. They said that being out
of work in England, they had realized their savings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and come to Paris, with the idea of selling fruit in the
streets. I asked them if they spoke the language,
and they said “not a word,” and they were in great
difficulty to know what to do, when they heard me
speaking English and stopped me. We got them
back to England the next day.</p>

<p>It was extraordinary the number of English
working people that turned up time after time, with
no knowledge of French, expecting to get work, and
had to go—or be sent—back, wiser men.</p>

<p>Owing to the great increase in motor cars, the
streets of Paris are particularly dangerous for pedestrians,
and accidents are of almost daily occurrence.
A peculiarly sad case was the following:</p>

<p>Two sisters, working girls (English), lived
together in the Rue ⸺. They worked in different
establishments, but generally met near the Madeleine
after working hours and went home together. On
this occasion one sister waited near the trysting place,
but her sister did not meet her. She noticed a crowd
round a neighbouring chemist’s, but did not enquire
what had happened, and went home.</p>

<p>It turned out that it was her sister who had been
carried into the pharmacy to die. Standing on the
“island of safety” opposite the Madeleine, her dress
had been caught by a passing motor, and she had been
dragged under it and killed. These two girls were
supporting an aged mother in England.</p>

<p>Another fatal accident which gave me a curious
experience was that of Madame J⸺, who was
run over by a cab and killed. In her pocket was
found a paper with my name and address written
upon it. She was an Englishwoman, widow of a
Frenchman, and used to earn her living by selling lace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
on commission. After the accident she was taken to
the Morgue. At that time this gruesome institution
was partly open to the public, and some of the bodies—not
identified—were exposed upon slabs behind
glass, others were kept in boxes in another part until
buried. The authorities sent for me, to see if I could
identify the body of this poor woman, which I was
able to do—but I shall never forget the horror of the
scene. The poor body was in a box without covering,
and so disfigured that I had some difficulty in convincing
myself that it was the person I expected. I
was glad to arrange for her decent burial.</p>

<p>One of the most melancholy of English suicides,
of which, alas, there are many, was that of Colonel
Hector Macdonald, in March, 1903.</p>

<p>He was staying at the Hotel Regina in the Rue de
Rivoli, and apparently after reading the “New York
Herald,” in which there was a paragraph stating that
grave charges had been made public against him, he
shot himself. After the necessary formalities the
body was removed to the Embassy Church in the
Rue d’Aguesseau before removal to Scotland. Colonel
Macdonald was a large man, and there being a double
coffin, we were unable to lower the body into the
mortuary, and this gave rise to a report that sufficient
reverence was not shown—a report which was without
any foundation.</p>

<p>Many members of the Scotch colony in Paris
visited the Church and placed flowers on the coffin,
and someone unknown sent a bunch of heather from
Scotland for a like purpose. It was a sad ending to
the life of a brave soldier.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="smaller">BRITISH CHARITIES IN PARIS.</span></h2>

<p>The British poor in Paris form no inconsiderable
part of the Colony. This arises largely from the fact
that it has been the custom in France to employ
Englishmen as coachmen and stablemen, many of
whom from one cause or another have fallen into
poverty. Others have taken advantage of the small
expense and gone to Paris in the hope of obtaining
work, which is by no means easy to find. Some
years ago many English were employed in various
works, but lately it is not so. When first I went to
Paris I held in the Montmartre district a weekly
service for the families of those employed in the gas
works in that neighbourhood, and had an attendance
of thirty to forty persons. But this gradually
dwindled, until at last there were none left—one after
another had been discharged and had taken their
families back to England.</p>

<p>In order to meet the need of the impecunious
British, several excellent charities have been established
in Paris. One of the most important of these
is the “British Charitable Fund.” This is a fund
which has existed many years in Paris, and it is interesting
to know that during the Franco-German war
and the Siege of Paris, it still carried on its work,
giving out food to those poor English people who had
been unable to leave the beleaguered city.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 475px;" id="illus19">
<img src="images/illus19.jpg" width="475" height="700" alt="" />
<p class="caption">SIR JOHN PILTER.</p>
</div>

<p>In former years it was a most difficult matter to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
raise sufficient funds to meet the various calls, and
there were all sorts of expedients for raising money.
Now, happily, the fund is in a healthy condition,
owing to a generous legacy by the late Captain
Briscoe, and very good work is being done. The fund
is managed by a committee, of which His Majesty’s
Ambassador is President, and the British Consul-General
the Chairman. The executive is an undenominational
body, and the members usually attending
during my time were: the English Church clergyman,
the Roman Catholic priest, and the Scotch
clergyman, and one or two laymen—Sir John Pilter
being a most regular and valued member. Sir John
Pilter is one of the best known members of the
English Colony, and is always forward in every good
work both with means and personal effort. The secretary,
Mr. Reginald Gesling, is a well-known figure in
the English colony, and an invaluable presence at the
weekly board. Being gifted with a remarkable
memory for faces, it is hard indeed for the would-be
impostor to pass his scrutiny. I have known him
recognise a man who had not been before the committee
for thirty years.</p>

<p>The weekly meetings of the board, which I
attended (with rare exceptions) during my sixteen
years in Paris, were full of interest and a curious study
of human nature. All sorts and conditions of men
came there, with all sorts of stories. We had clergymen
and Roman Catholic priests, lawyers, soldiers
and sailors, black and white, Boer and Briton, from
all parts of the world. Sometimes it was a man sent
as far as Paris by the Consul at Marseilles, whom we
had to send on. At another, members of an English
circus which had failed asked to be sent home. Clowns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and ballet girls, in fact “artists” (as they call themselves)
of all kinds were frequently before the committee.
The Home Government give some assistance
towards the repatriation of British people, or this
would be a serious drain upon the fund, and, moreover,
the Western Railway of France conveys these
unfortunate people at a reduced rate. There are often
curious scenes at the Gare St. Lazare on Wednesday
evenings, when these people are being sent off. There
is frequently a reluctance to go at the last minute on
the part of those who have long resided in Paris, and
all sorts of dodges have been resorted to to avoid the
train. I knew of one case where a woman having a
ticket to London left the train at Rouen, and in a
short time came up smiling before the committee again.</p>

<p>The distribution of charity is ever a difficult
matter, and while every care was taken, we were no
doubt often imposed upon. We have an excellent
lady visitor, Miss Beaton, who spares no time or
energy in finding out the merits of each case. Here
is a curious instance:</p>

<p>On one occasion a woman came to the committee
in widow’s weeds, leading a string of children, and in
tears. She said her husband (a printer) was dead
and buried. She would not return to England, and
asked for help for herself and children. The committee
were touched, and made a generous allowance,
which went on for some weeks.</p>

<p>One day the Secretary (Mr. Gesling) met the
husband (supposed to be dead) in the street. He
went up to him and questioned him, and discovered
that he knew nothing of his wife’s deception. I
believe she is really a widow now, and receives help
from the committee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>It was astonishing how many English people lost
their purses, either on the journey over or soon after
arriving in Paris. Almost every week we had the
same story, which, in many if not most cases, was
only an excuse either for having given way to drink,
or having been in bad company.</p>

<p>The committee is always desirous to get British
people who are not doing well to return to their own
country, especially the younger people. Old people
who have lived most of their life in France and have
lost all their relatives cannot well be sent home. The
fascination of Paris is, however, so great, that it is
often very difficult to persuade even the poorest to
leave, and all sorts of excuses are given against
leaving. Upon one occasion an old man came to the
committee asking for relief. He was asked “How
long have you been in France?” He replied “Over
twenty years.” “Do you speak French?” “Only
a few words, sir.” (This is quite possible. Englishmen
working together in a stable will have little need
to speak the language.) “Are you in work?” “No,
sir.” “Have you any prospect of work?” “I think
not.” “Will you return home?” A decided “No,
sir.” He was then asked a number of questions in
the endeavour to discover his reasons for wishing to
stay, as he was getting old, was unmarried, and had
no relatives in France. At length, with some reluctance,
he said, “Well, sir, its the wine. We can’t
get the claret in England.” And nothing would persuade
him to return. He is probably still there,
ekeing out a miserable existence. I am glad to hear
that the committee are about to purchase or build
more suitable premises in which to carry on this
important work. This is a real necessity, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
present rooms are too small and badly ventilated.
Visitors are always welcome on Wednesday afternoons
when the committee meets, and the study of human
nature at these gatherings is most interesting. There
are usually between 90 and 120 applications for relief
each week.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the British Charitable Fund
is the “Hertford British Hospital.” This was the
noble gift to the Colony of the late Sir Richard
Wallace, Bart., and was partly the outcome of the
Franco-German war, and the Commune in 1870-1871.
This philanthropic nobleman opened a hospital in the
Rue d’Aguesseau for the reception of wounded, and in
January, 1871, added two wards for the “Sick British
Poor,” and also a dispensary. At the end of the year
only one soldier remained under treatment, and upon
his discharge it was closed. A few weeks subsequently
Sir Richard Wallace communicated to his friends his
intention to found and endow a hospital in Paris for
poor British subjects, to be called the “Hertford
British Hospital,” in memory of the late Marquis
of Hertford. The foundation stone of the present
building was laid by Sir Richard and Lady Wallace in
August, 1877, and opened at a visit of the late Lord
Lyons in 1879. The hospital was visited in June,
1879, by their Majesties King Edward VII. and Queen
Alexandra (then Prince and Princess of Wales), who
named the principal wards “Albert Edward” and
“Alexandra.” In 1900 Lady Wallace made over the
hospital by deed to the British Government, who appointed
the present management. This hospital is
especially fortunate in having an endowment sufficient
for its requirements, so that the management have no
need to apply for subscriptions. The hospital contains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
40 beds and cots, and has an average number of
350 in-patients, and some 2,000 out-patients.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;" id="illus20">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="700" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HERTFORD BRITISH HOSPITAL.</p>
</div>

<p>It can hardly be realized, except by those resident
abroad, what a boon an English hospital, with
English doctors and nurses, is to the British poor.</p>

<p>One cannot speak too highly of the kindness of
the French hospitals in receiving English people for
treatment, and I received many testimonies from
grateful patients of the benefits obtained. I frequently,
however, heard the poor say: “When one is
ill, it is such a blessing to be able to talk your own
language to those about you,” or “I am afraid they
did not treat me properly because I could not explain
to them the symptoms,” and such sayings illustrate
what I am sure all feel, viz.: that it is very difficult
in illness to explain as one would wish to one who is
a stranger to our language. So that the English
hospital for this reason (and it is only one of many)
is a real boon to the British poor in Paris. You no
sooner pass the iron gate than you feel as if you were
in England. The porter speaks to you in your native
tongue; the secretary (though a first-rate French
scholar) greets you in the same language. The wards
are bright, cheerful, and (especially) airy, and all the
surroundings are such as we are accustomed to in our
own land. The nurses are all English, and most of
them have had experience in hospitals at home. All
are under the guidance of an experienced matron,
chosen from among many applicants for the post. I
have known hundreds of the British poor who have
been treated there, and they often are in difficulty to
find words to express their gratitude. Certainly the
works of Sir Richard Wallace do follow him.</p>

<p>If there is any drawback in this splendid institution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
it is the lack of a separate building for the treatment
of infectious cases; and also of a pay ward. This
want necessitates a poor Britisher with consumption,
small pox, etc., being taken to a French hospital,
which often is not desirable, and sometimes a great
hardship. The need of a pay ward is also a real one. It
often happens that an English person is taken ill in an
hotel where it is difficult to get proper treatment, and
where expenses are apt to increase very materially
under the circumstances. To some hotels doctors
are “attached,” who charge exorbitant fees, and, it
is said, divide the proceeds with the proprietor. In
such cases it would be the greatest boon if the patients
could avail themselves of a British hospital, and they
would no doubt willingly pay for the necessary treatment.
But notwithstanding these omissions, the
Hertford Hospital is doing a splendid work, and is an
enduring monument to its generous founder.</p>

<p>Another British charity in Paris is the “Victoria
Home for Aged Women,” founded by my predecessor,
the Rev. Howard Gill, in the year 1888. He found,
as I did subsequently, that there were English women
who had been governesses, ladies’ maids, and domestic
servants, living in loneliness and poverty, generally
at the top of the great houses in Paris, where the
rents—and the ceilings—are low. For the most
part they had led honourable lives, and were
respected and helped by the families where
they had worked. But they were old, they
had lived most of their lives in France, any
friends they had in England were dead and gone, and
they had no wish to return to their native land, indeed
it would be cruel to compel them to do so. The idea
of a home where such could be lodged, free of rent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
took shape in the year of the late Queen’s Jubilee in
1887. It was then decided that after the expenses
of the Celebration, the fund collected should be applied
to the establishment of a Victoria Home for the Aged
British Poor. However, the fund collected was not
sufficient, so it was eventually decided to apply the
interest of it in Victoria pensions, until the necessary
amount should be collected. However, Mr. Gill
would not allow his scheme to rest, and receiving
generous help from a few friends, he started a Home
on a small scale. This was inaugurated by the
Dowager Lady Lytton in December, 1888, and has
proved a real success. The conditions of entry may
seem rather “stiff,” but the fact that there has never
been a vacant room shows that they need not at
present be relaxed. The applicant must be a British
subject, over 65 years of age, of good character, and
have resided at least 30 years in France. It was one
of my most pleasing duties during sixteen years to
visit this “Home,” and to act as chairman of the
committee. Most of the old ladies had an interesting
story to tell, and they never wearied relating their
experiences. Those who had been governesses in
French families delighted to tell of the young ladies
to whom they had taught English, and watched over
until they had married. The kindness of some of
these ladies to their old teachers and nurses was most
touching. The late Sir Condie Stephen, an attaché
at the Embassy, took a kind interest in one of these
inmates, and regularly sent her a present until the
time of her death. All these old ladies had passed
through the siege of Paris and the Commune, and had
interesting stories to tell of that tragic time. I
remember one of them shewed me some of the meal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which was served out during the siege—very coarse
and dirty, and mixed with particles of wood. The
Dowager Lady Lytton and her daughters, and afterwards
the Dowager Lady Dufferin and her daughters,
the Ladies Blackwood, took the warmest interest in
the Home, and were constant visitors. Members of the
English and American Colonies constantly go out to
see the inmates, foremost amongst whom I must mention
Miss Thorndike, one of the oldest American residents
in Paris, who frequently gives a tea and presents
of warm clothing, which are much appreciated.
Formerly we rented a house in the Rue Borghèse,
Neuilly, but lately a house has been purchased in the
Boulevard de la Saussais, and is now being enlarged
and made more suitable as a permanent home for this
deserving class. Visitors to Paris will always be
welcomed by the excellent matron and her daughter,
Mrs. and Miss Ffarmer.</p>

<p>Another institution in Paris which is doing an
admirable work is the British Schools. These schools
were established in 1832, in order to afford a sound
education to English-speaking children of the working
classes resident in the city, and to enable them to
retain their knowledge of the English language. A
small fee is charged to those parents who are in a
position to pay, and the fees of the poorer children
are paid by the British Charitable Fund. I cannot
speak too highly of the good work done in these
schools, under the mastership of Mr. R. Smith. The
children receive an education in both French and
English—a French mistress is always employed.
They learn shorthand and typewriting in both languages,
and thus are able to obtain good positions in
French business houses. Indeed it is often difficult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to supply the demand for both boys and girls competent
to take such posts. The children are taught
patriotic songs, and every endeavour is made to instil
into their minds love and loyalty for their own
country. This is very necessary, for I found that
children of English parents who did not avail themselves
of the advantages of the schools, had the
tendency to forget their own tongue, and to gradually
become French. The chairman of the schools is Sir
H. Austin Lee, who takes the warmest interest in its
welfare, while Mr. H. Webster is untiring in his work
as secretary and treasurer.</p>

<p>The Girls’ Friendly Society is a splendid institution
in Paris, hardly perhaps to be designated as a
charity. When I first commenced work in the
City it was doing but little, but of late years it has
become a society of the first importance for looking
after English girls abroad. It is, of course, a branch
of the London G.F.S., which has its ramifications
all over Europe. English girls come in very large
numbers to Paris as typists, governesses, nurses,
etc., and it is very important that they should be
looked after in a city so full of temptations. The
society took a new lease of life during the time when
the Dowager Lady Dufferin was at the Embassy. It
was in debt and other difficulties, and the work was
comparatively small. Lady Dufferin seeing the possibilities
took up the matter with her usual energy.
The debt was soon paid, the difficulties removed, and
the work placed on a firm basis. From that time
to the present the society has prospered, and when I
left Paris had some 300 English girls under its care.
The system of the G.F.S. is just what is needed on
the Continent. Each girl has a lady associate, who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
her friend to whom she can always apply. If she
moves to another city she is recommended to
a Lady Associate there, and is met at the
railway, and looked after. I used frequently to visit
the charming lodge in the Avenue d’Jéna, and often
on Sunday afternoons (the great gathering time for a
free tea) gave an address to the girls. The work of
the chaplains in Paris is much lightened by the kind
help of the excellent ladies at the head of the lodge.
Indeed, one may say that the need of English girls in
Paris is fully met by this society, and the Y.W.C.A.,
under the fostering care of Mrs. Hoff. This excellent
lady devotes a large portion of her time and wealth to
work among American and English girls, and meets
their need, and especially that of American artists, in
the beautiful homes she has established.</p>

<p>The “Ada Leigh” homes have done a good work
in the past. The Y.M.C.A. has for years had a
branch in Paris, and done a good work, under the
devoted presidency of the late H. Skepper.</p>

<p>These are the principal British charities in Paris.
There are other smaller and more private charities
which were less under my notice, but of which I
would write, but for want of space.</p>

<span class="smaller">BRITISH JOURNALISTS IN PARIS.</span></h2>

<p>It was my privilege to know most of the
journalists representing the leading English papers,
frequently meeting them at the various public functions
and on other occasions. They are truly a body
of men of whom the Nation may be proud. Most
agreeable to meet and keen in their work, so much so
that very little escapes their notice.</p>

<p>The “Times” was represented during most of
my chaplaincy by that truly remarkable man M. O.
de Blowitz. It was said of him that on one occasion
at least (in 1875) he saved France from war. His
achievements during the Franco-German war in 1870
are well known. He was not striking in appearance:
small, nearly bald, rather insignificant looking, so that
it was hard on first acquaintance to realize that he
was the man whose deeds had startled Europe on
more than one occasion. He was, I believe, Austrian
by birth, but French by naturalization. His communications
to the “Times” were, I understand,
always in French; indeed, he was latterly more
French than anything else.</p>

<p>I once heard him try to make a speech in English,
and it was evidently with considerable difficulty.
He was naturally a constant visitor at the Embassy,
and was an especial favourite with the late Earl of
Lytton and his family. I used often to see him
driving in the Champs Elysées, and to meet him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
banquets and other occasions. In December, 1902,
the colleagues of M. de Blowitz joined in making him
a presentation in token of their admiration and
esteem. About a month after this, in January, 1903,
he passed away. His funeral was a very representative
one, a large number of his friends joining in the
last tribute. With the modern restrictions upon war
correspondents, can there ever be another Blowitz?</p>

<p>M. de Blowitz was succeeded by M. Lavino, who
had formerly been upon the staff of the “Daily
Telegraph” in their Paris office, and was afterwards
in Vienna. I met M. Lavino soon after he came to
Paris, and he made what struck me then as a peculiar
remark. After some moments conversation, he
said, “You know, Dr. Noyes, you will have to bury
me.” Of course I said I hoped not, but he seemed
to have a presentiment then that his days were numbered.</p>

<p>M. Lavino, though not so well known as M. de
Blowitz, had had a distinguished career. He was in
Paris when the Franco-German War broke out as
secretary to General Salazar, Minister of Ecuador in
Chicago. When the ill-fated Marshal Bazaine was
being condemned by the French for supposed
treachery, M. Lavino contrived to obtain a letter from
him in his own defence. From this time his success
was assured. Later he assisted Sir Campbell Clarke
on the Paris staff of the “Daily Telegraph,” and
subsequently went to Vienna to represent the same
paper. In 1892 he was appointed to represent the
“Times,” and upon the death of M. de Blowitz was
called to Paris. It was commonly said that M. Lavino
did much to help on the “Entente Cordiale,” not so
much by what he wrote as by bringing together leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
men of both nations, and so encouraging a better
understanding between them. M. Lavino frequently
expressed himself as favouring the action of the
French Government in its late struggle with the
Roman Catholic Church. M. Lavino struck me as a
kindly gentleman, observant, not fond of society—a
man one could safely trust.</p>

<p>He died suddenly on the evening of August 4th
of strangulated hernia and diabetes, the latter being
a disease from which he had long suffered.</p>

<p>The “Daily Telegraph” was represented almost
all my time by Sir Campbell Clarke. He was a man
of large means, having married a daughter of a proprietor,
and occupied a fine apartment in the
Champs Elysées. He was a most genial, kind man.
The late Lady Campbell Clarke was always ready to
help the needy, and frequently assisted me in our
charities by monetary help.</p>

<p>Sir Campbell Clarke was most ably assisted for
many years by Mr. W. F. Lonergan and Mr.
Ozane. The former has left Paris, while Mr.
Ozane still plies his busy pen in La Ville Lumière.
I feel sure that readers of the “Daily Telegraph”
always enjoy “Paris day by day,” written in such a
“newsy” style, and giving all the salient (though
sometimes unsavory) points in passing events. I owe
a large debt of gratitude to the Paris staff of the
“Daily Telegraph” on account of many kindnesses
received.</p>

<p>Mr. Hely Bowes and Mr. Farman represented the
“Standard,” succeeded by Messrs. Adkin Raphael
and Pountney. Mr. Farman’s son is very much
before the public at the present time, having invented
one of the most successful of the Flying Machines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
I knew Mr. Hely Bowes and his family very well.
They were regular members of my congregation in
the Rue d’Aguesseau. Mr. Bowes was a singularly
good French scholar and very witty. He was born
and brought up in France. His father was, I believe,
at one time upon the staff of the “Galagnani Messenger.”
I remember upon one occasion sitting near
him at a banquet. He was pouring out stories and
witticisms to his neighbour, a French Deputy. The
Minister was heard to ask afterwards “Who is that
remarkable Englishman? He speaks and tell stories
like a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>Mr. Hely Bowes died during my chaplaincy. I
visited him at the last, and was the first to convey
the sad news to Sir H. Austin Lee at the Embassy,
where he was so well known.</p>

<p>As I passed the Lodge I told the Concierge what
had happened, and raising his hands he exclaimed
“par exemple”—it seemed to me a curious expression
on such an occasion.</p>

<p>The “Daily News” and the “Morning Post”
were represented by Mr. J. Macdonald and Mr.
Raper, the latter of whom I knew very well.</p>

<p>Mr. Raper succeeded Mr. Arthur Gill (son of my
predecessor, the Rev. Howard Gill), who for a short
time represented the “Morning Post.”</p>

<p>The “Daily Mail” now occupies a unique and
very important position among the English papers
obtainable abroad. Having, in addition to a special
wire, a printing establishment in Paris, they can
produce a fac-simile edition of the London issue every
morning.</p>

<p>In times of National anxiety especially, it would
be hard to over-estimate the boon of such a paper.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
We had no such advantage, e.g., in the Boer War,
and the anxious longing for the evening post was very
trying, especially when one had relatives or friends
in the Army. The French papers gave short telegrams,
but these were often misleading and sometimes
untrue, and only added to the anxiety. But now this
is changed, and one can get a fairly full account of
English doings at the breakfast table in Paris.</p>

<p>As the paper can be dispatched by the early morning
trains, those in the South of France and other
parts get their British news at least twelve hours
earlier than heretofore.</p>

<p>During most of the time Mr. McAlpin represented
this paper, whom I well knew. Mr. Lane was also
upon the staff, and some others. Mr. McAlpin is now
no longer on the Paris staff of the “Daily Mail,”
and was succeeded by Mr. J. B. Brandreth, who is
well known in the journalistic world. The “Daily
Mail” has been the death of the “Galagnani Messenger”
which used to be so well known upon the
Continent.</p>

<p>For the American Colony in Paris there is no paper
like the “New York Herald.” This paper, owned
by Mr. J. Gordon Bennett, is a remarkable publication,
produced it is said at a loss, very chatty, and
containing daily current news from America. Before
the “Daily Mail” came to the front, most English
people took the “New York Herald,” as it gave a
certain amount of English news from the papers of
the day, and whetted the appetite for the London
paper which arrives in the evening.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Gordon Bennett is a well-known figure in
Paris. He is said to be several times over a millionaire—spends
freely, and is a great traveller and sportsman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
He has the knack of getting the men he wants
upon the staff of his paper, and of getting the best
out of them. But I am told the tenure of office there
is rather precarious. Many of the journalists of Paris
have been at one time or another on the staff of his
paper. I have also heard it said that the name of no
person disliked by the proprietor is allowed to appear
in the paper. The Editor publishes at times all
letters, etc., even though they revile the paper and
things American. A letter from an “old Philadelphian
lady” has been repeated daily for some years!</p>

<p>I received much kindness from the “Herald”
during my chaplaincy. I was never charged for any
advertisement, and any communications I sent were
always inserted.</p>

<p>Another journalist whom I often met was Mr.
Clifford Millage, who was the Paris correspondent of
the “Daily Chronicle,” and an ardent Roman
Catholic. He was fond of discussing theological subjects—an
able man, and well thought of among his
confrères. He passed away in 1903. I may also
mention Mr. Strong, Mr. Longhurst, and Mr.
Fullerton, among those from whom I received kindness
from time to time. I was brought a good deal
into contact with the late Mr. Cuntz, who managed
the “American Register”—owing to serious illness
in his family.</p>

<p>Besides the journalists of the sterner sex, there
are also ladies who are well known as brilliant
writers for various society and other papers. I may
mention among those whom I was privileged to
know, Mrs. Emily Crawford. This lady was in Paris
during the war of 1870, and the almost more terrible
Commune that followed. She writes for the “Daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
News” and “Truth,” and has published a memoir
of our late beloved Queen, under the title “Victoria,
Queen and Ruler.” Mrs. Crawford is well known in
all literary circles in Paris.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alison Robson I knew for almost the whole
of my chaplaincy. She is a clever writer for the
“Queen,” under the nom de plume of E. de Campo
Bello. Mrs. Robson went as special correspondent
to the Hague at the time of the wedding festivities of
the Queen of Holland; and also Madrid, when the
King of Spain came of age. She gave us a most
interesting account of these visits.</p>

<p>Many of my readers who can recall the great
“Times” trial will remember the names of Pigott,
and Tynan (the famous No. 1, who it was
said gave the signal for the murder of Lord F.
Cavendish). It was a curious coincidence that both
these men were living at one time in my Parish of
Christ Church, Kingstown. I often made purchases
at the little bookshop kept by Tynan, and sometimes
spoke with him. During my stay in Paris I had a
visit from the famous le Carron, who for a long time
was a member of the Clan-na-Gael in New York, and
informed the Home Government of their proceedings.
He told me that he was formerly a choir boy in the
Embassy Church, and he related to me some of his
thrilling adventures. He died of consumption soon
after his visit to Paris.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of the yearly customs on fête days in Paris
are peculiar, and those occurring in the winter season
are less familiar than others—to English visitors.
New Year’s Day, the “Jour de l’an,” is kept as a
National Holiday, and presents of flowers and “objets
d’art” are sent amongst friends. Christmas
Day is not kept with the like solemnity and joyousness
as with us—though becoming more a fête than it formerly
was. Upon New Year’s Day beggars are
allowed in the streets, and it is often a ghastly spectacle
to see the poor creatures in all conditions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
deformity asking alms. A good deal is distributed
amongst them, as the French are very charitable to
the Poor. At this season “booths” are allowed on
the Boulevards, when all sorts of toys, etc., are exposed
for sale, some of them mechanical and very
ingenious. They are supposed for the most part to
have been made in the homes of the poor.</p>

<p>Shrove Tuesday (Mardi-gras) and Mid-Lent (Mi-carême)
are also general holidays. On the former
there is a procession of fat cattle, and a throwing of
confetti in the main streets and Boulevards, where
vehicular traffic is suspended. I have seen the Grand
Boulevards literally six inches deep in confetti on a
fine day. Mi-carême is marked by a procession of the
washerwomen, and in many particulars resembles our
Lord Mayor’s Show on November 9th, only it is more
fantastic. The Grand Car on these occasions is reserved
for the Queen of the Laundries, who has been
solemnly chosen for her beauty. She rides triumphant,
surrounded by her “Court”—sometimes
rather scantily dressed for the cold weather, and stops
at the Elysée, where she generally receives a present
of a bracelet at the hands of the President of the
Republic. These functions are well worth seeing—once.</p>

<p>The National Fête, to celebrate the declaration of
the Republic, being in warmer weather (July), is
usually more of a festival in the open-air, and is kept
up late and early. Many families leave Paris for the
country before it comes off. It is emphatically the
people’s fête, and one feature of it is that dancing is
allowed in the streets. Bandstands are erected,
usually opposite a restaurant, and in the evenings
people gather in large numbers. Inmates of flats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
near these bandstands suffer much (I write from experience),
for being the hot weather windows must
be open, and the noise is deafening.</p>

<p>“All Souls’” and “All Saints’” Days are religiously
kept by most Parisians, and thousands go to
the cemeteries to place flowers on the graves of their
relations. It is a very interesting sight, and visitors
to Paris should not omit on these days to go to Père-la-Chaise,
Passy, Bolougne-sur-Seine, or one of the
other cemeteries.</p>

<p>The French pay great respect to the dead. No
funeral cortège is allowed to trot in Paris whatever
the distance to the cemetery, and most men raise their
hats and women cross themselves as the body passes
in the streets. Soldiers and officials always salute.</p>

<p>Burials are a monopoly in Paris. The Pompes
funèbres is a great company, who have decorations arranged
and always ready for every church in Paris,
and everyone is buried by them, and in the “class”
they choose to pay for. There are seven or eight
“classes,” and it is so arranged that the rich pay for
the poor. A first-class funeral is very rare, as it costs
a very large sum. Officials attend the poor man’s
funeral—only less gorgeously dressed—equally with
the rich, and all things are done decently and in order.
As a sign of the times, not long before I left Paris,
I was called upon to take a funeral of an American
at St. Germain, some miles outside the fortifications.
The family and friends went down by train, and I
went with the body, but in a motor-fourgon (hearse).
When we left the gates of the city we travelled very
rapidly.</p>

<p>I noticed a marked change during my life in Paris
in the keeping of Sunday. Twenty years ago many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
shops were open, and there was little to distinguish it
from any other day. Now most places of business
are closed. Leagues were formed some years ago,
advocating one day’s rest in seven, and quite lately
(1907) a law was passed requiring that all employés
should cease work on Sunday. Those compelled
to work on that day (in restaurants, etc.) must
have another day. Alas! the change is not due to a
religious but a secular movement, and is solely to
oblige one day’s rest in the seven as a holiday. As
far as it goes it is a good thing for the people, and
it is pleasant to see the orderly crowds enjoying the
open air in the Bois, the Parc Monceau, and other
places, while one regrets the irreligion which is so
characteristic of the nation at this time.</p>

<p>The well-known Mark Twain (Mr. Clements) came
to Paris to complete (so I understood) one of his
books. No one knew of his presence amongst us for
some time. When I heard of it I went to see him
in his hotel in the Rue de Rivoli to ask him to give
a public reading from his works for the benefit of the
proposed Church House. He put me off in his
characteristic way. I then went to see the Marquis
of Dufferin and Ava—our Ambassador at that time—and
asked him if he would give a room at the Embassy
if I could persuade Mark Twain to read. He
kindly agreed, and so did Mr. Clements. We had a
splendid success, the rooms were crowded. We obtained
twenty francs a ticket, and cleared some £200.
American humour is sometimes difficult for English
people to appreciate, but no one could resist Mark
Twain. I shall always feel grateful to him for his
kind help on that occasion.</p>

<p>Among the many artists it was our privilege to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
know in Paris was the eminent sculptor, Mr. Bruce
Joy. He had then a studio in the city. We still
possess a replica of his well-known bust of the late
Archbishop Benson.</p>

<p>Paris is a city which might well be compared to
the Adulamites Cave, where all in distress and difficulty
congregate. Among the unfortunates was the
late Oscar Wilde. I had known him a little in Dublin
as a student, and had also met him at Lady Wilde’s
receptions. He came to Paris to die. When I heard
of his serious illness I went down at once to enquire,
but found he had passed away. The “concierge”
told me that he had been visited by a Priest, and
baptized into the Roman Church. As is often the
case, the Baptism was administered when the patient
was “in extremis,” and knew nothing about it. The
Roman Church, however, claimed to take the funeral,
and I could not object.</p>

<p>Curious mistakes were sometimes made by the
French Postal authorities, owing to the difficulty
of language. Each Easter it was my custom
to send out a card to the members of the congregation
giving notice of the services, and at the foot a suitable
quotation from the Scriptures. In 1895, I sent out
the card as usual, and the passage was “The Lord is
Risen.” One came back to me through the dead-letter
office addressed to “The Lord is Risen, 5 Rue
d’Aguesseau.”</p>

<p>All sorts of ideas and rumours were circulated
when the French Church was separated from the
State. One morning a French gentleman called at
the Vestry and asked me if it was true that Sir
Francis Bertie, our present Ambassador in Paris,
had purchased the Madeleine Church, our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
being too small! This is somewhat parallel to
the story of an Irish clergyman, who told me that
the day after the bill passed to disestablish the Church
in Ireland he heard in the early morning a scythe
going in his field. A stranger was cutting his hay.
Upon enquiry, the man said: “Sure, sir, the Church
is disestablished now, and I thought I would come
early for my share!”</p>

<p>The French often make curious mistakes in their
translations into English, but the same may be said,
and perhaps more so, with respect to our renderings
into French, e.g., A young English girl was heard to
exclaim “Je suis cheval,” desiring to say she was
hoarse. And another, who had a touch of the same
complaint, “Je ne peux pas hirondèle,” meaning
she could not swallow. Upon another occasion, when
called to play in public, a girl said “Je suis sûre de
casser-en-bas,” in her fear of coming to grief. It
was rather a peculiar way to express hurry, when one
said “Je suis dans une dépèche.” I suppose most
have heard the story told by Dean Pigou, of Bristol,
of the lady (I believe an American) who, desiring a
cab, called out “Cochon êtes-vous fiancé.” Another
story, which was current in my time, is worth repeating.
A girl who had been but a few months in Paris
learning French was taken out by her parents to a
restaurant. Looking over the menu, she was asked
to translate the sentence “Ris de Veau à la financière,”
which she told her delighted parents was
“the calf laughs at the Banker’s wife.” Many of
such mistakes arise when young people are placed
in French families where no English is spoken at all,
and so their errors pass uncorrected.</p>

<p>Among the remarkable men who lived and died in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Paris during my chaplaincy was Mr. H. A. M. Butler-Johnstone.
He had been for sixteen years Member
of Parliament for Canterbury, and as a youth was at
Eton, at the same time as His Majesty King Edward.
He was closely identified with the young Turkey party
in Paris. He was on his way to the Post Office in
October, 1902, when he died suddenly in the street
near the Place Vendome. He was staying with his
wife at the Hotel Continental, but there being no
funds, his funeral was undertaken by the British
Charitable Fund. I conducted his funeral, which
was attended by quite a number of the Turkish
Colony in Paris. It was said that his financial ruin
was caused by his having lent £200,000 to the Turkish
Government in 1877 to resist the encroachments of
Russia. To raise this sum he sold his pictures to
the National Gallery, as well as his estates in England.
It was said that he gave great offence to the
late Marquis of Salisbury by the attitude he took up
on the Russo-Turkish War.</p>

<p>In January, 1907, there was a remarkable gathering
of eighty-six Prelates of the Roman Church in
Paris to discuss the attitude of the Church towards
the recently passed “Law of Separation.” What
seemed the more remarkable was that the gathering
was held at the Château de la Muette Passy, the residence
of the Count and Countess de Francqueville, and
that the Countess presided at the lunch, she being a
member of the Anglican Communion. The Countess,
as is well known, is the daughter of the Earl of
Selbourne, and niece of the late Bishop of Southwell.</p>

<p>The concierge or hall porter occupies a responsible
position in the Paris house. A common answer to
the question “Is life worth living?” is—it depends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
upon the concierge. There is no doubt that a disagreeable
concierge can make things very uncomfortable,
and it is necessary when taking an “appartement”
to gain his goodwill by a good tip. Otherwise
letters which are delivered at the lodge may not be
brought up as soon as they should be, and other little
annoyances will frequently occur. It is customary
to give 50 to 100 francs to the concierge on New
Year’s day, according to the rent paid, to secure
civility and good service through the year. The concierge
is the servant of the proprietor and not of the
tenant. Every quarter the rent is paid to the concierge,
and must be paid in cash. The cheque
system as we have it in England is but little used in
France.</p>

<p>When I handed a cheque for my first quarter’s
rent to the concierge he looked at it, and said “What
is this?” I was compelled to go down to the Bank
and get the money for him!</p>

<p>In taking an appartement (or flat) in Paris, the
greatest care is necessary. The “etat de lieu” or
state of the flat must be taken both by the architect
of the landlord and your own. A document is drawn
up, and signed by both parties. Unless this is done
all sorts of charges may be made when the tenant
leaves the flat, as, e.g., for every nail in the walls or
floors, every scratch on the paint, etc. I bought my
experience rather expensively in one of the flats I
occupied.</p>

<p>Owing, it is said, to the lack of population, the
law as to nationality presses hard upon some
foreigners in France. The law at present is that
“all children of parents born in France are French,”
and male children thus born are liable for military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
service. I knew several young men who were thoroughly
English, and who had always kept up their
connection with England and the English Colony in
France, who, nevertheless, owing to the fact that
their parents were born in the country, were
accounted French, and had to go through their
military service, and were liable to be called up in
time of war. It has naturally followed that when an
interesting event is expected in a British family, and
where it can be managed, a temporary change to the
English climate has become desirable. But this law
presses very hardly upon the poor.</p>

<p>I am often asked as to whether it is more expensive
to live in Paris than in London. My experience
is that London is the dearer city. In Paris almost
everyone lives in a flat, where it is not necessary to
keep so many servants as a house requires. Wages
are about the same; but servants in France are
much more economical than in England. Food is
dearer as it is mostly taxed—the exception being
fruit and vegetables, which come into Paris free of
duty. Wine of home culture is now exempt. Coal
is very expensive, being generally over £2 a ton; but
then less is used, as the houses in the best parts of
the city are generally warmed. There is, however,
no income tax in France, and the municipal taxes are
much less—about one-half what they are in London.
But the days when people would go to Paris to largely
economise are past; both capitals are expensive for
the upper and middle classes.</p>

<p>The carte telegram or “Petit bleu” is an advantage
in Paris which one misses much in London.
This is a system by which a letter written on a
special form, which can be sealed and posted in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
special box, with a threepenny stamp, will be
delivered in the city, by means of pneumatic tubes,
within an hour. It is a great convenience, and
largely used by Parisians.</p>

<p>The post offices, however, often afford a trying
experience. The officials seem in no hurry to attend
to the customers, and there is no appeal. They do
not seem to consider themselves the servants of the
public in any way, and so the public suffer. The
“Bureaux de Post” are frequently badly ventilated,
so that a long delay is not always agreeable.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PRESENT CONDITIONS OF RELIGIOUS LIFE ON
THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE, AND THEIR LESSONS
FOR THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO-DAY.</span></h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">A Paper read at the Yarmouth Church Congress,
October 2nd, 1907.</p>

</div>

<p>I ventured to accept the proposal that I should
speak to you to-day upon the ground that I had been
for the past sixteen years chaplain in Paris, with
certain opportunities for gathering some information
upon the subject before us.</p>

<p>What I have to say will naturally refer chiefly to
France, which during the past few years has been
passing—with somewhat grim silence—through a
bloodless Revolution.</p>

<p>The long story, of which the present condition of
religious life in that country is the sequel, has been
as to its earlier stages so ably dealt with by the previous
speaker that I will not occupy your time by a
further reference to it.</p>

<p>To come to recent events. During the years
1897-1900 France was stirred to its depths over the
Dreyfus “affaire.” It was in the air—everyone
talked about it, and the controversy was full of bitterness.
The policy of the Ultramontane party with
respect to this question can only be described as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
deplorable. At any cost this unfortunate Jew must
be proved guilty, apparently with the hope that thus
feeling would be stirred up in the country against all
Jews, and non-Roman Catholics, and the Church
come again into the favour she was fast losing. The
reaction that came when it was seen that a great
blunder had been made was remarkable; and there
was considerable irritation against those who had, it
was felt, deceived the people. Yet there are some in
France who still would have us believe that Dreyfus
is guilty! The country had been steadily becoming
indifferent to religion, but that indifference was
largely changed into open hostility in the reaction
after the exposures which were made in this
“affaire,” which had indeed brought the country
perilously near civil war.</p>

<p>It was in the year 1900 that the French Government
took action against the Augustinians, or
Assumptionists. Hitherto the “Orders” had been
treated with more or less of indifference, but at this
time the country woke up to the fact that this body
was publishing a newspaper (“The Croix”), which
was acquiring a leading position so far as circulation
was concerned. In every café, in every village, it
had its agents; and while acting under the cloak of
religion—the crucifix being printed on the front page,
with a representation of the “flag of the Sacred
Heart”—it was really a political organ—its object
was revolutionary—and aimed at the existing
Government. It is only fair, however, to say that
this organ, while largely used, was never officially
sanctioned by the Church. The Government becoming
aware of the danger promptly seized the press,
suppressed the Order of the Assumptionists, and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to further measures. M. Clemenceau showed,
in an able speech, that in very many cases these
so-called religious orders were nothing else than huge
trading establishments, some of which had made
great fortunes by the manufacture of wines and
liqueurs, and that a considerable amount of “sweating”
was practised by those in authority over them.</p>

<p>In 1901, M. Waldeck Rousseau being Prime
Minister, the “Associations Bill” was brought into
the Chamber of Deputies. This Bill required all congregations
to be authorized. Existing congregations
were to obtain authorization, and no new ones could
be formed without this authority. The Bill was no
doubt aimed chiefly at the various “orders,” several
of which were not authorized, as, e.g., the Jesuits
and the Dominicans. Desperate efforts were made
in the Chamber to defeat the Government, but the
Bill was carried by 303 votes to 224. Soon after this,
M. Waldeck Rousseau retired, nominating M.
Combes as his successor.</p>

<p>In 1902 the elections were held, and the Government
“went to the country” upon the Associations
Bill. Contrary to the expectations of the Ultramontane
party, and showing how rapidly it was losing its
hold upon the people, the elections were decidedly in
favour of the Government. M. Combes, in the same
year, suppressed 127 establishments (monasteries
and convents) which were not authorized. Many
thought he acted with undue severity, and disturbances
took place in various parts. It has, however,
to be remembered that with the Government it was
a struggle for life, and as a leading statesman expressed
it, “The religious orders are a State within
a State, and capable of undermining the most solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
edifice raised by a most united people.” M. Combes
has frequently said that he had no intention at this
time of going so far as to propose the breaking of the
Concordat—not that he objected to it, but he did not
believe that the country was ripe for it. The somewhat
extraordinary action of the Vatican, and the
support of the Government by the people, carried
him on.</p>

<p>An event took place soon after which accentuated
the friction between the Government and the
Vatican. M. Loubet (President of the Republic)
had decided to pay an official visit to the King of
Italy. This was considered an insult to the Vatican,
which had for a long time endeavoured to keep
France and Italy apart. Protest was made to the
French Government, and every engine of diplomacy
used to arrange a visit to the Pope before the audience
with the King of Italy. M. Loubet and the Government
refused to be dictated to, and as M. Combes put
it in a speech subsequently made, “We will not
allow the Papacy to intermeddle in our international
relationships, and we intend to have done once for
all with the fiction of the Temporal Power.” This
sounds very much like the sentence in our own Constitution:
“The Pope of Rome hath no jurisdiction
in this realm of England.”</p>

<p>The mass of the people—with whom M. Loubet
was popular—sided with the Government, and the
gulf was made a little wider.</p>

<p>Following this incident came the case of the two
Bishops, Mgr. le Nordez, Bishop of Dijon, and Mgr.
Geay, Bishop of Laval. These two ecclesiastics
were accused of certain crimes against morality, and
of Freemasonry. The excitement was widespread,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and eventually the bishops were summoned to Rome.
In conformity with the terms of the Concordat, they
informed the French Government of this order, who
forbid them to leave the country, as the summons
was irregular. From this time a battle began between
the Vatican and the French Government, until
at length the two bishops yielded, and went to Rome
to be tried, and eventually resigned their bishoprics.
This was regarded as a great triumph for the Ultramontane
party.</p>

<p>But what followed caused considerable consternation,
for on July 29th of that year the Papal Nuncio
was informed by M. Delcasse that there was no need
for him to remain longer in France. I shall not soon
forget the excitement in Paris at this decided step.
Parliament, however, approved of what had been
done, and thus the way was prepared for the breaking
of the “golden chain” of the Concordat, and the
final rupture with the Vatican. Great events followed
with striking rapidity.</p>

<p>On December 9th, 1905, the law was passed
severing the connection between Church and State,
which was completed on March 16th, 1906, by the
“Reglement d’Administration publique.” It was
legislation for which the country had proved to be
ripe.</p>

<p>The series of events which I have briefly referred
to had hastened the crisis. No greater mistake could
be made than to imagine it was merely a political
measure arising from irritation. It was inevitable—it
was but the “registration of an existing fact.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the Bill itself was much more generous
and favourable than it might have been, and is not
rightly described as “persecution.” It is no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
anti-clerical, but that does not mean that it is altogether
anti-religious. In the Chamber of Deputies
the other day the Abbé Lemire could say that “he
believed in the sincerity of those who say they
wished to make the law of separation a law of liberty
and toleration, as well for the Church as for the
State.”</p>

<p>The first article of the Bill reads thus: “The
Republic assures liberty of conscience and guarantees
the free practise of religion subject only to the
restrictions hereinafter enacted, in the interest of
public order.”</p>

<p>The second article says: “The Republic neither
recognises nor salaries nor subsidises any religion”—in
future budgets “all expenses connected with
the practise of religions” would be omitted, and
public religious establishments would be suppressed.
Provision is, however, made for the continued services
of chaplains in public institutions, a provision
which shows an absence of an altogether anti-religious
bias in the Bill.</p>

<p>The ceasing of grants for religious services means,
of course, an enormous loss to the Roman Church,
and a proportionate loss to the Protestant and Jewish
Churches also. It is a credit to the Roman Church
that this financial loss has not been represented as
the chief grievance.</p>

<p>The articles 3 and 4 in the Bill have been those
most bitterly opposed by the Ultramontane party.
The former required an “inventory” to be made of
all Church property, which was then to be transferred
to the “Associations Cultuelles,” who were
to hold it in the future as “representatives of the
religion which has now the use of it.” The taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of this “inventory” was made the occasion of considerable
disturbance. In Paris this was especially
so at the Church of S. Clothilde, where there was a
free fight. The names of the arrested, however,
clearly showed that the demonstration was political
rather than religious, and engineered mainly by the
Royalist party. There is also another fact not generally
known, and that is, that the opportunity was
being taken by dealers from Paris and London to purchase
valuable plate and pictures from the Churches
throughout the country, substituting for them others
of little value, and the Government was really protecting
Church property by taking these inventories.</p>

<p>By article 4 the “Association Cultuelles” were
to receive the property as being representatives of the
“Religion that now has the use of it.” These
associations were to be formed in every parish, the
members forming it being proportionate to the population.
The priests might be members, and would
in most cases nominate the other members.</p>

<p>Thus it would seem a door was open by which a
“modus vivendi” might have been arranged between
the Vatican and the State. The French bishops realized
this, and at their first meeting decided to accommodate
themselves to the law. They were convinced
by a majority of twenty-two that it would be possible
to form associations which, “without violating the
separation law, would maintain the essential rights
of the Church, her Divine constitution, and her
hierarchy.” But the Vatican would not consent.</p>

<p>Later, the Archbishop of Besancon proposed a
scheme for the formation of “Associations Canonique,”
which, according to the Abbé Houtin, was
approved by the bishops by 56 votes against 18.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
This scheme was also rejected, the Pope declaring
that he would not permit their trial “so long as he
had no certain and legal guarantee that the Divine
constitution of the Church, the immaculate rights of
the Roman Pontiff and the Bishops, and their
authority over the necessary property of the Church
(particularly over the sacred edifices) would be
irrevocably and fully assured by the said associations.”
So came a deadlock—on all points the
Vatican had refused compliance with the new law,
and practically declared war against the Government.
With apparently a real desire to meet the difficulty,
the Government fell back temporarily upon the law
of 1881, which required a simple declaration to be
made of the intention to hold Divine service, this
declaration being only necessary once a year. This
proposal was under discussion at the famous meeting
of the French Bishops at La Muette, Paris, in
January of this year. We gather from reliable
sources that there was a disposition on the part of the
bishops to accept this solution of the difficulty, when
a telegram was received from the Vatican forbidding
it.</p>

<p>Thus we arrive at the present state of the religious
question in France. The Church is separated from
the State—the Papal Nuncio has been banished
from France, the bulk of the people are only nominal
adherents of the Church, and they love to have it so.</p>

<p>It must be evident to most who have followed this
controversy that Rome has herself fledged the arrow
which has brought her down. For a long time she
has been losing her hold upon the people, so that to-day,
out of thirty-nine millions in the country, it is
calculated that only four to five millions are devout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
adherents of the Papacy. This fact it is that accounts
for the absence of any serious uprising during this
momentous change which has so recently taken
place.</p>

<p>Mr. F. Harrison relates his impressions during a
late visit to France in the “Nineteenth Century”
for August, and says:—“Of the great religious
struggle not a trace was to be seen.… I entered
the churches and attended the services at all
hours, and was almost always alone. In Notre
Dame, in Paris, on Trinity Sunday last there were
fifty-two women and twenty-five men.” He adds,
“The State was only concerned with the overthrow
of a great political conspiracy; there was no trace of
a great religious struggle, because none took place.”</p>

<p>Visitors to Paris during the season may get a very
erroneous impression as to the true state of religious
life. A few of the leading churches may be filled,
e.g., the Madeleine, S. Sulpice, S. Clothilde, and
some others, but one has to take into account the
fact that Paris is much under-churched for the population,
and that many of those attending in the
season are from the provinces, and, I am sorry to say,
some English Churchpeople. So with regard to
Sunday. A great change has taken place in France.
Visitors of twenty years ago will remember that the
shops in Paris were for the most part open, but now
they are very generally closed. It would, however,
be a mistake to suppose that this change arose from
a religious feeling. It is rather that France had
decided to keep one day in seven for pure pleasure,
and Sunday has been chosen as the most convenient
day. The theatres and other amusements are open,
and thronged as before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>During the last sixteen years—with the exception
of the monumental building upon the hill of Montmartre,
I never saw any important new church in
building, or heard of one being erected.</p>

<p>And what is the reason of this state of things, from
which we as a Church may gather some lessons?
They are many. Rome in France, as in other countries,
is rather a political than a religious system.
She was involved more than was generally known in
the Dreyfus affair. The banished Orders were sowing
the seeds of disloyalty to the Republic. S. Cyr
(the military school) was largely under the influence
of the Jesuits, who are not Republicans, and the
struggle had to come. “France is democratic and
progressive. In spite of eminent exceptions, the
Roman Catholic body has offered a sullen and stubborn
opposition to economic and social reform. It
reaps what it has sown.” And this is an object-lesson
to ourselves. Now the attitude of the nation
towards Roman Catholicism is one of distrust and
aversion. A Church—a clergy—these, though he
may not personally use them—the average Frenchman
will have. But what he will not have at any
price is a Government influenced by priests—a
Roman Catholic “party”—or the intervention of
Rome, secret or avowed, in French politics. The
fact is that Rome has asked the people to believe too
much, and they have ended by believing very little.
It is a sad spectacle. But what has the Church
offered to combat the growing materialism of the
country? Only the poor substitute of superstition,
such as is manifested at Lourdes and other places.
This and the Dreyfus affair, and the scandal connected
with the name of Leo Taxil, have done much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in late years to alienate thinking Frenchmen from
religion.</p>

<p>Again, the selling of the offices and sacraments
has in Paris at least been practised to an extraordinary
extent. Before the separation, I have
known of as much as £1,000 being paid for the services
at a “rich” funeral. £80 to £100 was a
common fee for marriages and funerals, and large
offerings were expected at baptisms. Since the passing
of the Bill the Archbishop of Paris has ordered
that marriages and funerals should only be taken in
a low “class,” where the fees are comparatively
moderate. But I am credibly informed that it is
expected that an “offering” will be given to the
officiating priest equal to what was formerly charged.
This relates, of course, only to the wealthier class,
from whom the complaints have been deep if not
loud.</p>

<p>And what is the outcome of all this? Here you
have a dissatisfied priesthood, especially as to the
younger men; it is calculated that some two hundred
secede from the priesthood every year; a people who
have thrown over their Church and practically banished
religion from their schools. You have teachers
who have a better chance of employment and promotion
if they are free-thinkers. Consequently juvenile
crime is increasing, and immorality more or less
rampant. Here are two facts. According to the
official journal, during the year 1905, 3,805 boys of
sixteen years of age passed through the police courts,
and 566 girls of the same age; and in the same year
there were 468 cases of suicide of men and women
under twenty-one years of age. Again, in Paris
alone the illegitimate births are over 12,000 a year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
while in London, with its much greater population,
the number for 1906 was 4,868.</p>

<p>What is the remedy? Certainly a revival of religion
will not come through politics—but will it come
from the Church herself?</p>

<p>There is a Liberal school of Roman Catholic
Theology in France from which some hope much.
M. Paul Sabatier (who has written so much and so
well upon this subject) has great hopes that the
Church in France will be saved by this party. But
it is a party which has no favour from Rome, and
time alone will show whether anything can be accomplished
by it. Some, indeed, there are who think
that the somewhat mysterious action of the Pope in
the late controversy with the Government arose from
the existence and strength of this “Liberal” party,
and the latest Papal pronouncement seems to favour
this view. This school—historical, liturgical, and
critical—has broken down the intellectual conceptions
on which Romish doctrine rests; and if its
views are accepted by Roman Catholics generally,
then the Vatican sees clearly that it cannot sway the
minds of the people and bring them to obey
implicitly.</p>

<p>It would appear that the Curia sees that the doctrines
of Liberalism, once adopted, will overthrow
Romanism, and in its desire to save the Church
allows the French Catholics to be persecuted, knowing
that persecution will confirm Conservatism, and
drive the really attached Ultramontanes closer to the
Roman authority. The Pope’s action is, in fact, the
inevitable result of Ultramontanism, for nowadays no
Romanist can be anything but an Ultramontane if he
is loyal to the Papacy. Thus the action of the Pope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
may not be a diplomatic mistake so much as the outcome
of a steady policy to maintain unity on the
basis of the Vatican decrees and the syllabus.</p>

<p>The lessons for the Church of England are obvious.
It may be that France is in the van of a
larger movement for good or for evil. Spain, Italy,
Germany, are in the throes of the same struggle.
Anti-clericalism is not unknown among ourselves.
Surely we may learn the danger of a too close alliance
with any political party. The Church, as her Divine
Founder, should be non-political. And should not
every nerve be strained to keep our people in close
attachment to the Church, by active sympathy with
the masses, putting before them a manly Christianity
and avoiding mediævalism and superstition? And
must we not fight for schools, that definite religious
instruction be given to our children, which will equip
them as none other can for the responsibilities of
national life, and for the life to come? If we learn
these lessons while the day lasteth, “quis separabit.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="smaller">THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND ON THE CONTINENT.</span></h2>

<p>The position and work of the Church of England
upon the Continent is not understood as it should be
by British people in general. It is difficult to overcome
old prejudices, and there is no doubt but that in
former times (now happily gone by) there was a distinct
prejudice against the Continental Chaplain. It
was generally thought that he must either be on the
Bishop’s “black list,” or have been guilty of some
grievous fault to be found upon the Continent at all.
And this prejudice was hardly to be wondered at. It
is not very many years ago since no Bishop was found
to be superintending the chaplains, and there were
men ministering abroad who had left their country
for their country’s good. The history of Episcopal
supervision is briefly this. In the year 1663 “congregations
of the Church of England in foreign
countries” were placed under the jurisdiction of the
Bishop of London. This was in the reign of Charles I.,
and by an order of the King in council. And this
order held good for 200 years. During this period
there are little or no traces of any effectual Episcopal
supervision, neither is there any record of any Assistant
Bishop aiding the Bishop of London in this work.
We may, however, assume that the number of British
people travelling and resident upon the Continent was
nothing like what it is now. In the old days people
often took their carriage over the Channel and travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with servants and Courier, so that trips abroad
were only a luxury of the rich. And now the London
Polytechnic, e.g., take people over by thousands, and
offer a trip to “lovely Lucerne” with all the best
excursions, etc., for £5 5s.! When taking the chaplaincy
at Lucerne three years ago I was much
interested in the arrival of these weekly parties, and
in order to see how the excursions were managed went
with a party to the end of the Lake, and by Goschenen
to Andermatt, a lovely excursion; and I was indeed
surprised how well everything was done. The lunch
was plain but substantial, and all included in the five
guineas for a week’s trip.</p>

<p>But to return to Church matters. In 1825 Bishop
Luscombe was appointed to the Embassy Chaplaincy
in Paris, and to superintend British congregations on
the Continent. This could have been no sinecure,
when it is remembered that there was then no Bishopric
of Gibraltar, and that his appointment included
superintendence of the Church of England congregations
on the whole Continent, in Asia, and the
North of Africa.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to ascertain if there were any records
of Episcopal work done in these lands, but could find
no trace. The Embassy Chaplaincy was less important
then than it has since become, but my experience
has been that the work in Paris is both onerous and
constant, and that with all the chaplain may be able
to accomplish there is necessarily much left undone.
Twelve thousand English people scattered over a large
city must involve, as it does, heavy work.</p>

<p>In the year 1842, the Bishopric of Gibraltar was
founded; in this case a territorial title was available
owing to our possession of the impregnable rock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Forty-two years afterwards, in 1884, a most important
step was taken, and a Suffragan Bishop to the See of
London appointed to take jurisdiction over the congregations
in Northern and Central Europe. The
first was Bishop Titcomb, a man greatly beloved by
all who knew him, and one who never tired of doing
all he could to help and cheer his chaplains, many of
whom were in isolated posts and often very lonely.
Unfortunately he was only a few years at work, when
he was taken ill and died. His successor was the
Right Rev. Bishop Wilkinson, formerly of Zululand,
under whom I was privileged to serve during the
whole of my chaplaincy. I usually arranged for the
Bishop’s hospitality at the Embassy when he visited
us for Confirmations, and while I fear he does not
like Paris and big receptions, we were always pleased
to see him and fully appreciated his work amongst us.
The travelling in this (so-called) diocese is very fatiguing,
as it reaches from Calais to St. Petersburg,
and embraces Belgium, the North of France,
Germany, Norway, and Sweden, etc.</p>

<p>Thus the work of the Church of England upon the
Continent is within these two Dioceses—I use the
term as being the most convenient—and can, I
believe, be favourably compared with that in any
English or Colonial Diocese.</p>

<p>In both Dioceses there are permanent and temporary
chaplaincies. Permanent chaplaincies are
usually in towns, where there is a resident and commercial
colony, and where similar work is carried on
to that of an English parish. The temporary chaplaincies
are opened only in the season, and in places where
the English congregate for health, holiday, and pleasure.</p>

<p>The appointments to these chaplaincies are chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in the hands of the two well-known societies, the
Colonial and Continental Church Society and the
Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. All
licenses are issued by the Bishops of London and
Gibraltar. Since my removal from Paris I have been
a member of the Committee of the former Society,
and I can testify to the care which is taken to select
men suitable to the vacant positions.</p>

<p>In the chaplains, and especially in the case of those
permanent, English travellers abroad will generally
find a sympathetic friend, and one ready to give advice
or help whenever needed.</p>

<p>May I, in closing this short notice of a very important
and increasing work, plead for greater liberality
on the part of travellers. The chaplains are
often but poorly paid, and are in a large measure
dependent—in some cases entirely—upon the weekly
offertory. The number of nickel coins in the plate
week after week is a trying experience to the chaplain,
and seems to show but small appreciation on the part
of travellers of the advantage of a religious service
when abroad, and of the very great difficulty there
often is in keeping a chaplaincy open for want of funds.</p>

<p>In trouble and difficulty the chaplain is frequently
the one applied to, and then gratitude is expressed,
but it surely should not be left to such times; and the
plea of home calls and the expense of a holiday
abroad is not satisfactory or quite reasonable. But
what noble exceptions there are to the grudging giver!
I had for some years a member of my congregation
in Paris who regularly put a gold piece in the plate
on Sundays, and if away for three or four weeks
would, on her return, give for each Sunday of her
absence; and “God loveth a cheerful giver.”</p>

<span class="smaller">AMERICANS IN PARIS.</span></h2>

<p>The American Colony is not nearly so large as
the English in Paris, but it is important and influential.
According to the last census there were 5,000
Americans resident, or in hotels, while there were
12,000 English. The reason for this difference in
numbers is not far to seek. America is too distant,
and the voyage too expensive for the poor to readily
cross the great Atlantic; while for a few shillings
anyone can traverse the little “Manche” between
England and France and try their luck in the gay
City—generally looked upon in England as one vast
pleasure ground. Alas! these poor people often find
tears where they looked for laughter, and poverty where
they looked for gold. An American in distress from
poverty is a rarity. The few who are stranded in Paris
find many liberal helpers among their own country
people.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Americans thoroughly
appreciate the beauty and comfort of living in the
“Ville lumière,” and there are many residents who
have chosen it as a place of residence when free to live
anywhere. Then there are others who are married
to French, and thirdly, those who are studying
painting, singing, or architecture, or whose children
are being educated in that thorough way we in
England know so little of.</p>

<p>The English Chaplain comes into close contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with many Americans, both socially and ministerially.
Though the beautiful Church in the Avenue de l’Alma
was built for, and by, Americans, the English
Embassy Church counts among her faithful worshippers
many an American cousin. Doctor Morgan,
who has for many years ministered to the American
Church, and is so much beloved by all, quite recognised
that we must exchange many of our flock, and it
would not be possible, nor desirable, to keep to the
nationality of our congregation, especially as we are
in communion one with the other.</p>

<p>Socially, the English Chaplain must necessarily
meet many Americans. Naturally, those who speak
the same language (or nearly so) must draw together
in a strange country. But there is more than that,
as everyone knows, in the relationship of English and
Americans. Their outlook on life from childhood for
education, both in the home and school, is the same.
Until one has lived in a foreign country one hardly
realizes how this affects one.</p>

<p>The difference in the way a Frenchman regards
the question of morality and religion makes a barrier
which is not often bridged. The truly sympathetic
friendship between the Anglo-Saxon and the Frenchman
is the exception, and not the rule. In this way
the American and English in a foreign land draw
closer together, and consider themselves very much
as one family, with the same tastes and sympathies,
while they regard in quite a different light those they
call “foreigners,” though they may be living in that
“foreigners’” land, and would be quite offended if
the term were applied to them.</p>

<p>We made many friends among the Americans,
and we can never think of our life in Paris as separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
from those dear ones. Indeed, the house which my
family and I have come to regard as a second home,
and where the welcome is always that of a kind sister,
belongs to an American who was, and is still, one of
the most regular attendants at the English Church.
I cannot too often testify to the liberality of the
Americans in Paris in helping the British poor.
They were ready at all times to give of their money
and time for this purpose, and I cannot remember a
single instance when I appealed in vain for their aid.
At a large working party formed for making clothes
for the British poor, we had not only the attendance
of many Americans, but the beautiful and commodious
rooms of the Hotel Powers were lent to us
free of charge by their American owner.</p>

<p>When we had bazaars for the Church, several
stalls were taken by Americans, and at concerts given
for charitable purposes it was in many cases to the
American Colony we owed both the talent which
attracted the large attendance, and also the results we
generally obtained.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most notable of the American
millionaires when I first went to Paris was Mrs. Ayer.
She was almost mobbed when she went out on
account of her wonderful jewels, which represented
a large fortune. I have seen people standing on
chairs in a drawing-room to get a better sight of her—or
of them! Indeed, royalty could hardly compete in
notoriety with this little old lady.</p>

<p>Mrs. Astor in her beautiful flat in the Champs
Elysées (which she called only a little “pied-à-terre”)
gave most enjoyable soirées, and her beautiful
manners added not a little to the pleasure of her
guests. She had the great charm of making no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
difference in her welcome, whether the guest was a
prince or a poor curate, and one went away with the
delightful feeling that you were the person she had
most wished to see, and you had given her much
pleasure by your presence!</p>

<p>The late Mrs. Warden-Pell also entertained a good
deal, and she often, at her afternoon receptions, when
great artists delighted her audience, gave young
students an opportunity of being heard—an opportunity
which was worth a great deal to them, and
which they were not slow to appreciate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Whitelaw-Reed, who has since become so
well known as the wife of the Ambassador in London,
did a great deal for the artists in the Latin quarter,
and her work has borne much good fruit.</p>

<p>I must also speak of Mr. and Mrs. Mason, the
American Consul and his wife, who have for many
years won the love and admiration of all nationalities
and classes in the most cosmopolitan town—Paris.
Their house is always open to those who require aid
or sympathy, and it is not only Americans who seek
it there. Mrs. Mason may be seen at all gatherings
in any way connected with charity, and we English
often forgot that we had no real claim upon her and,
I fear, trespassed on her kindness.</p>

<p>I have spoken elsewhere of Mrs. Hoff and the good
work she helps so liberally. The annual banquets of
the American Chamber of Commerce and the July
celebrations were always important functions, and I
have thus had the great pleasure of listening to some
of the most eloquent speakers in America and France.
It was the usual custom to have present a contingent
of the “Garde Républicain,” and their bright
uniforms added much to the brilliancy of the scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
At one of these functions quite an ovation was given
to General Horace Porter. He was the means of
restoring to America all that was left of “Paul
Jones,” the founder of the American Navy. General
Porter paid all the expenses of transport, etc., which
were enormous, and the body was taken through the
streets with great pomp and “éclat,”—both in Paris
and New York.</p>

<p>I cannot mention the many Americans whose
kindness to me was unfailing, and can only add that
without the Americans in Paris the English Chaplain’s
life would be less agreeable, and his financial responsibilities
more difficult to maintain.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="smaller">L’ENVOI.</span></h2>

<p>My departure from Paris came about in rather a
curious way. In April and May, 1906, we had a visit
from the late Dean Barlow (of Peterboro’). For the
first of May (“Labour Day”) we had arranged a
Drawing-room Meeting for the Dean on behalf of the
Colonial and Continental Church Society, whose work
in Canada was, and is, attracting so much attention
in religious circles. It turned out, however,
to be one of those “scares” with which
Paris is sometimes afflicted, and the idea having
got abroad that something dreadful was about
to happen, only three people turned up!
The Dean was very kind about it, and notwithstanding
the small number present, gave us a most
interesting account of his recent visit to Canada. The
next morning when he was leaving, he turned to me
and said, “Noyes, how long have you been here?”
I told him nearly sixteen years, and added, “You
must not leave me here too long.” The Dean had very
considerable influence in Church patronage, and when
he wrote to me in the spring of 1907, he said, “Do you
remember what you said to me when I was leaving
your house last year? Well, I have ventured to put
your name forward for an important Church in London.”
So slight often are the incidents which bring
about changes in our lives. I had never heard of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Mary’s, Kilburn, or been in this part of London
before I came over to see the Church.</p>

<p>The saying “good-bye” is always trying, and
especially after a long ministry among such a devoted
congregation as I had in Paris. I preached a farewell
sermon to a large congregation on Friday, June 9th,
1907, and although I struggled hard against it, completely
broke down.</p>

<p>The next day I had to face a large gathering in the
Washington Palace, to receive a most gratifying testimonial.
The spacious room was crowded, and the
kind expressions of regret almost overwhelming. It
was here I was able to make the announcement that
I had received a few days previously from a generous
donor, who wished to remain anonymous, the magnificent
gift of £4,000 towards the Paris Church
House.</p>

<p>The following account appeared in the papers of
the succeeding day:—</p>

<p>“At the Washington Palace this afternoon took
place the presentation by Mr. Percy Inglis, British
Consul-General, to the Rev. H. E. Noyes, D.D., of
the testimonial from the congregation of the church
in the Rue d’Aguesseau, consisting of an illuminated
address, a cheque, and a flagon, in the presence of a
large gathering, among whom were Sir Henry Austin
Lee, Doctor Sewell, Mr. H. Millington Drake, the
Very Rev. Father McMullan, Mr. Lammin, Mr. Le
Cocq, and Mr. Coleman. Mr. Inglis read, amid great
applause, the address, which is a tribute to the
excellent work performed by Doctor Noyes during his
sixteen years’ residence in Paris. In his reply Doctor
Noyes related all that had been done for the charitable
and other institutions of the colony during that period<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>,
and spoke very feelingly of the hearty support which
he had received throughout from the Embassy and all
its members. He noted this as especially interesting,
that during that time he had seen four Ambassadors
at the mansion in the Faubourg Saint Honoré, and no
fewer than five Presidents of the Republic. Great
enthusiasm was displayed when the reverend gentleman
announced that he had received last week from a
donor whose name could not be revealed the magnificent
sum of 100,000 frs. for the contemplated clergy
house. Afterwards Doctor and Mrs. Noyes took a
hearty farewell of all their friends, with the expression
of the hope that they would meet again in Paris
and at their new home in London.”</p>

<p>My successor, as is well known, is the Right Rev.
Bishop Ormsby (late of Honduras), and it is a curious
circumstance that when I was curate of St. Matthias’s
Church in Dublin, one of the congregation was Judge
Ormsby, the father of the Bishop.</p>

<p>I left Paris with many regrets, and often have
wondered since whether I had not been there too long
to leave it. But the die is cast, and I can only now
in quiet moments wander in thought over the familiar
scenes, and think of the many kind friends, the
memory of whom will never fade.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
